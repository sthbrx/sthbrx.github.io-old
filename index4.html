  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've only been working on the Linux kernel for a few months.  Before that, I worked with proprietary source control at work and common tools like GitHub at home.  The concept of the mailing list seemed obtuse to me.  If I noticed a problem with some program, I'd be willing to open an issue on GitHub but not to send an email to a mailing list.  Who still uses those, anyway?</p>
<p>Starting out with the kernel meant I had to figure this email thing out.  <code>git format-patch</code> and <code>git send-email</code> take most of the pain out of formatting and submitting a patch, which is nice.  The patch files generated by <code>format-patch</code> open nicely in Emacs by default, showing all whitespace and letting you pick up any irregularities.  <code>send-email</code> means you can send it to yourself or a friend first, finding anything that looks stupid before being exposed to the public.</p>
<p>And then what?  You've sent an email.  It gets sent to hundreds or thousands of people.  Nowhere near that many will read it.  Some might miss it due to their mail server going down, or the list flagging your post as spam, or requiring moderation.  Some recipients will be bots that archive mail on the list, or publish information about the patch.  If you haven't formatted it correctly, someone will let you know quickly.  If your patch is important or controversial, you'll have all sorts of responses.  If your patch is small or niche, you might not ever hear anything back.</p>
<p>I remember when I sent my first patch.  I was talking to a former colleague who didn't understand the patch/mailing list workflow at all.  I sent him a link to my patch on a mail archive.  I explained it like a pull request - here's my code, you can find the responses.  What's missing from a GitHub-esque pull request?  We don't know what tests it passed.  We don't know if it's been merged yet, or if the maintainer has looked at it.  It takes a bit of digging around to find out who's commented on it.  If it's part of a series, that's awkward to find out as well.  What about revisions of a series?  That's another pain point.</p>
<p>Luckily, these problems do have solutions.  <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">Patchwork</a>, written by fellow OzLabs member <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org">Jeremy Kerr</a>, changes the way we work with patches.  Project maintainers rely on Pathwork instances, such as <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org">https://patchwork.ozlabs.org</a>, for their day-to-day workflow: tagging reviewers, marking the status of patches, keeping track of tests, acks, reviews and comments in one place.  Missing from this picture is support for series and revisions, which is a feature that's being developed by the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop</a> project.  You can check out their changes in action <a href="https://patchwork.freedesktop.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, Patchwork helps patches and email catch up to what GitHub has in terms of ease of information.  We're still missing testing and other hooks.  What about review?  What can we do with email, compared to GitHub and the like?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the biggest feature of email is the ease of review.  Just reply inline and you're done.  There's inline commenting on GitHub and GitLab, which works well but is a bit tacky, people commenting on the same thing overlap and conflict, each comment generates a notification (which can be an email until you turn that off).  Plus, since it's email, it's really easy to bring in additional people to the conversation as necessary.  If there's a super lengthy technical discussion in the kernel, it might just take Linus to resolve.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to just replying to email, too, such as <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>.  Gerrit's pretty popular, and has a huge amount of features.  I understand why people use it, though I'm not much of a fan.  Reason being, it doesn't add to the email workflow, it replaces it.  Plaintext email is supported on pretty much any device, with a bunch of different programs.  From the goals of Patchwork: "patchwork should supplement mailing lists, not replace them".</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds famously explained why he prefers email over GitHub pull requests <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17">here</a>, using <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/linux.kernel/w957vpu3PPU">this</a> pull request from Ben Herrenschmidt as an example of why git's own pull request format is superior to that of GitHub.  Damien Lespiau, who is working on the freedesktop Patchwork fork, <a href="http://damien.lespiau.name/2016/02/augmenting-mailing-lists-with-patchwork.html">outlines on his blog</a> all the issues he has with mailing list workflows and why he thinks mailing lists are a relic of the past.  His work on Patchwork has gone a long way to help fix those problems, however I don't think mailing lists are outdated and superceded, I think they are timeless.  They are a technology-agnostic, simple and free system that will still be around if GitHub dies or alienates its community.</p>
<p>That said, there's still the case of the missing features.  What about automated testing?  What about developer feedback?  What about making a maintainer's life easier?  We've been working on improving these issues, and I'll outline how we're approaching them in a future post.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In POWER land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> is mostly known as the method to access the machine's console and start interacting with Petitboot. However it also has a plethora of other features, handily described in the 600ish page <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-second-gen-interface-spec-v2-rev1-1.html">IPMI specification</a> (which you can go read yourself).</p>
<p>One especially relevant feature to Petitboot however is the 'chassis bootdev' command, which you can use to tell Petitboot to ignore any existing boot order, and only consider boot options of the type you specify (eg. 'network', 'disk', or 'setup' to not boot at all). Support for this has been in Petitboot for a while and should work on just about any machine you can get your hands on.</p>
<h2>Network Overrides</h2>
<p>Over in OpenPOWER<sup>1</sup> land however, someone took this idea and pushed it further - why not allow the network configuration to be overwritten too? This isn't in the IPMI spec, but if you cast your gaze down to page 398 where the spec lays out the entire format of the IPMI request, there is a certain field named "OEM Parameters". This is an optional amount of space set aside for whatever you like, which in this case is going to be data describing an override of the network config.</p>
<p>This allows a user to tell Petitboot over IPMI to either;</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the network completely,</li>
<li>Set a particular interface to use DHCP, or</li>
<li>Set a particular interface to use a specific static configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these options will cause any existing network configurations to be ignored.</p>
<h2>Building the Request</h2>
<p>Since this is an OEM-specific command, your average ipmitool package isn't going to have a nice way of making this request, such as 'chassis bootdev network'. Rather you need to do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="x">ipmitool -I lanplus -H </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">yourbmc</span><span class="x"> -U </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">user</span><span class="x"> -P </span><span class="p">$</span><span class="nv">pass</span><span class="x"> raw 0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80 0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21 0x00 0x01 0x06 0x04 0xf4 0x52 0x14 0xf3 0x01 0xdf 0x00 0x01 0x0a 0x3d 0xa1 0x42 0x10 0x0a 0x3d 0x2 0x1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Horrific right? In the near future the Petitboot tree will include a helper program to format this request for you, but in the meantime (and for future reference), lets lay out how to put this together:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Specify the &quot;chassis bootdev&quot; command, field 96, data field 1:
    0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80

Unique value that Petitboot recognises:
    0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21

Version field (1)
    0x00 0x01 ..   ..

Size of the hardware address (6):
    ..   ..   0x06 ..

Size of the IP address (IPv4/IPv6):
    ..   ..   ..   0x04

Hardware (MAC) address:
    0xf4 0x52 0x14 0xf3
    0x01 0xdf ..   ..

&#39;Ignore flag&#39; and DHCP/Static flag (DHCP is 0)
    ..   ..   0x00 0x01

(Below fields only required if setting a static IP)

IP Address:
    0x0a 0x3d 0xa1 0x42

Subnet Mask (eg, /16):
    0x10 ..   ..   ..
Gateway IP Address:
    ..   0x0a 0x3d 0x02
    0x01
</pre></div>


<p>Clearing a network override is as simple as making a request empty aside from the header:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80 0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00
</pre></div>


<p>You can also read back the request over IPMI with this request:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0x00 0x09 0x61 0x00 0x00
</pre></div>


<p>That's it! Ideally this is something you would be scripting rather than bashing out on the keyboard - the main use case at the moment is as a way to force a machine to netboot against a known good source, rather than whatever may be available on its other interfaces.</p>
<p>[1] The reason this is only available on OpenPOWER machines at the moment is that support for the IPMI command itself depends on the BMC firmware, and non-OpenPOWER machines use an FSP which is a different platform.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In early February I had the opportunity to go the the NICTA Systems Summer School, where Cyril and I were invited to represent IBM. There were a number of excellent talks across a huge range of systems related subjects, but the one that has stuck with me the most was a talk given by <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/">Luis Ceze</a>  on a topic called approximate computing. So here, in hopes that you too find it interesting, is a brief run-down on what I learned.</p>
<p>Approximate computing is fundamentally about trading off accuracy for something else - often speed or power consumption. Initially this sounded like a very weird proposition: computers do things like 'running your operating system' and 'reading from and writing to disks': things you need to always be absolutely correct if you want anything vaguely resembling reliability. It turns out that this is actually not as big a roadblock as I had assumed - you can work around it fairly easily.</p>
<p>The model proposed for approximate computing is as follows. You divide your computation up into two classes: 'precise', and 'approximate'. You use 'precise' computations when you need to get exact answers: so for example if you are constructing a JPEG file, you want the JPEG header to be exact. Then you have approximate computations: so for example the contents of your image can be approximate.</p>
<p>For correctness, you have to establish some boundaries: you say that precise data can be used in approximate calculations, but that approximate data isn't allowed to cross back over and pollute precise calculations. This, while intuitively correct, poses some problems in practise: when you want to write out your approximate JPEG data, you need an operation that allows you to 'bless' (or in their terms 'endorse') some approximate data so it can be used in the precise file system operations.</p>
<p>In the talk we were shown an implementation of this model in Java, called <a href="http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/research/approximation/enerj.html">EnerJ</a>. EnerJ allows you to label variables with either <code>@Precise</code> if you're dealing with precise data, or <code>@Approx</code> if you're dealing with approximate data. The compiler was modified so that it would do all sorts of weird things when it knew it was dealing with approximate data: for example, drop loop iterations entirely, do things in entirely non-determistic ways - all sorts of fun stuff. It turns out this works surprisingly well.</p>
<p>However, the approximate computing really shines when you can bring it all the way down to the hardware level. The first thing they tried was a CPU with both 'approximate' and precise execution engines, but this turned out not to have the power savings hoped for. What seemed to work really well was a model where some approximate calculations could be identified ahead of time, and then replaced with neural networks in hardware. These neural networks approximated the calculations, but did so at significantly lower power levels. This sounded like a really promising concept, and it will be interesting to see if this goes anywhere over the next few years.</p>
<p>There's a lot of work evaluating the quality of the approximate result, for cases where the set of inputs is known, and when the inputs is not known. This is largely beyond my understanding, so I'll simply refer you to some of the papers <a href="http://sampa.cs.washington.edu/research/approximation/enerj.html">listed on the website</a>.</p>
<p>The final thing covered in the talk was bringing approximate computing into current paradigms by just being willing to accept higher user-visible error rates. For example, they hacked up a network stack to accept packets with invalid checksums. This has had mixed results so far. A question I had (but didn't get around to asking!) would be whether the mathematical properties of checksums (i.e. that they can correct a certain number of bit errors) could be used to correct some of the errors, rather than just accepting/rejecting them blindly. Perhaps by first attempting to correct errors using the checksums, we will be able to fix the simpler errors, reducing the error rate visible to the user.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the NICTA Systems Summer School to be a really interesting experience (and I hope to blog more about it soon). If you're a university student in Australia, or an academic, see if you can make it in 2017!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently most of us attended LCA2016. This is one set of reflections on what we heard and what we've thought since. (Hopefully not the only set of reflections that will be posted on this blog either!)</p>
<p>LCA was 2 days of miniconferences plus 3 days of talks. Here, I've picked some of the more interesting talks I attended, and I've written down some thoughts. If you find the thoughts interesting, you can click through and watch the whole talk video, because LCA is awesome like that.</p>
<h4>Life is better with Rust's community automation</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIageYT0Vgg">This talk</a> is probably the one that's had the biggest impact on our team so far. We were really impressed by the community automation that Rust has: the way they can respond to pull requests from new community members in a way that lets them keep their code quality high and be nice to everyone at the same time.</p>
<p>The system that they've developed is fascinating (and seems fantastic). However, their system uses pull requests, while we use mailing lists. Pull requests are easy, because github has good hook support, but how do we link mailing lists to an automatic test system?</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is something we're working on: we already have <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/">Patchwork</a>, and <a href="https://openpower.xyz/">Jenkins</a>: how do we link them? We have something brewing, which we'll open source real soon now - stay tuned!</p>
<h4>Usable formal methods - are we there yet?</h4>
<p>I liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxHjhBVOCSU">this talk</a>, as I have a soft spot for formal methods (as I have a soft spot for maths). It covers applying a bunch of static analysis and some of the less intrusive formal methods (in particular <a href="http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/">cbmc</a>) to an operating system kernel. They were looking at eChronos rather than Linux, but it's still quite an interesting set of results.</p>
<p>We've also tried to increase our use of static analysis, which has already found a <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/580629/">real bug</a>. We're hoping to scale this up, especially the use of sparse and cppcheck, but we're a bit short on developer cycles for it at the moment.</p>
<h4>Adventures in OpenPower Firmware</h4>
<p>Stewart Smith - another OzLabber - gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XGvssR-ag">this talk</a> about, well, OpenPOWER firmware. This is a large part of our lives in OzLabs, so it's a great way to get a picture of what we do each day. It's also a really good explanation of the open source stack we have: a POWER8 CPU runs open-source from the first cycle.</p>
<h4>What Happens When 4096 Cores <code>All Do synchronize_rcu_expedited()</code>?</h4>
<p>Paul McKenney is a parallel programming genius - he literally <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html">'wrote the book'</a> (or at least, wrote <em>a</em> book!) on it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nfpjHTWaUc">His talk</a> is - as always - a brain-stretching look at parallel programming within the RCU subsystem of the Linux kernel. In particular, the tree structure for locking that he presents is really interesting and quite a clever way of scaling what at first seems to be a necessarily global lock.</p>
<p>I'd also really recommed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFmajPt0_hI">RCU Mutation Testing</a>, from the kernel miniconf, also by Paul.</p>
<h4>What I've learned as the kernel docs maintainer</h4>
<p>As an extra bonus: I mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsJXf6oSbAE">this talk</a>, just to say "why on earth have we still not fixed the Linux kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/README">README</a>"?!!?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started at IBM I knew how to alter Javascript and compile it. This is because of my many years playing Minecraft (yes I am a nerd). Now I have leveled up! I can understand and use Bash, Assembly, Python, Ruby and C! Writing full programs in any of these languages is a very difficult prospect but none the less achievable with what I know now. Whereas two weeks ago it would have been impossible. Working here even for a short time has been an amazing Learning experience for me, plus it looks great on a resume! Learning how to write C has been one of the most useful things I have learnt. I have already written programs for use both in and out of IBM. The first program I wrote was the standard newbie 'hello world' exercise. I have now expanded on that program so that it now says, "Hello world! This is Callum Scarvell". This is done using strings that recognise my name as a set character. Then I used a header file called conio.h or curses.h to recognise 'cal' as the short form of my name. This is so now I can abbreviate my name easier. Heres what the code looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;string.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>
<span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;curses.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<p>The last two lines have been left out to make it a challenge to recreate. Feel free to test your own knowledge of C to finish the program! My ultimate goal for this program is to make it generate the text 'Hello World! This is Callum Scarvell's computer. Everybody else beware!'(which is easy) then import it into the Linux kernel to the profile login screen. Then I will have my own unique copy of the kernel. And I could call myself an LSD(Linux system developer). That's just a small pet project I have been working on in my time here. Another pet project of mine is my own very altered copy of the open source game NetHack. It's written in C as well and is very easy to tinker with. I have been able to do things like set my characters starting hit points to 40, give my character awesome starting gear and keep save files even after the death of a character. These are just a couple small projects that made learning C so much easier and a lot more fun. And the whole time I was learning C, Ruby, or Python I had some of the best system developers in the world showing me the ropes. This made things even easier, and much more comprehensive. So really its no surprise that in three short weeks I managed to learn almost four different languages and how to run a blog from the raw source code. The knowledge given to me by the OzLabs team is priceless and invaluable. I will forever remember all the new faces and what they taught me. And the <em>Linux Gods</em> will answer your prayers whether e-mail or in person because they walk among us! So if you ever get an opportunity to do work experience, internship or a graduate placement take the chance to do it because you will learn many things that are not taught in school.</p>
<p>If you would like to reveiw the source code for the blog or my work in general you can find me at <a href="https://github.com/CallumScar">CallumScar.github.com</a> or find me on facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/callum.scarvell/about">Callum Scarvell</a>. </p>
<p>And a huge thankyou to the OzLabs team for taking me on for the three weeks and for teaching me so much! I am forever indebted to everyone here.   </p></div>
