  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a hobbyist programmer and Linux user, I was pretty stoked to be able to experience real work in the IT field that interests me most, Linux. With a mainly disconnected understanding of computer hardware and software, I braced myself to entirely relearn everything and anything I thought I knew. Furthermore, I worried that my usefulness in a world of maintainers, developers and testers would not be enough to provide any real contribution to the company. In actual fact however, the employees at OzLabs (IBM ADL) put a really great effort into making use of my existing skills, were attentive to my current knowledge and just filled in the gaps! The knowledge they've given me is practical, interlinked with hardware and provided me with the foot-up that I'd been itching for to establish my own portfolio as a programmer. I was both honoured and astonished by their dedication to helping me make a truly meaningful contribution!</p>
<p>On applying for the placement, I listed my skills and interests. Having a Mathematics, Science background, I listed among my greatest interests development of scientific simulation and graphics using libraries such as Python matplotlib and R. By the <em>first day</em> they got me to work, researching and implementing a routine in R that would qualitatively model the ability of a system to perform common tasks - a benchmark. A series of these microbenchmarks were made; I was in my element and actually able to contribute to a corporation much larger than I could imagine. The team at IBM reinforced my knowledge from the ground up, introducing the rigorous hardware and corporate elements at a level I was comfortable with.</p>
<p>I would say that my greatest single piece of take-home knowledge over the two weeks was knowledge of the Linux Kernel project, Git and GitHub. Having met the arch/powerpc and linux-next maintainers in person placed the Linux and Open Source development cycle in an entirely new perspective. I was introduced to the world of GitHub, and thanks to a few rigorous lessons of Git, I now have access to tools that empower me to safely and efficiently write code, and to build a public portfolio I can be proud of. Most members of the office donated their time to instruct me on all fronts, whether to do with career paths, programming expertise or conceptual knowledge, and the rest were all very good for a chat.</p>
<p>Approaching the tail-end of Year Twelve, I was blessed with some really good feedback and recommendations regarding further study. If during the two weeks I had any query regarding anything ranging from work-life to programming expertise even to which code editor I should use (a source of much contention) the people in the office were very happy to help me. Several employees donated their time to teach me really very intensive and long lessons regarding the software development concepts, including (but not limited to!) a thorough and helpful lesson on Git that was just on my level of understanding.</p>
<p>Working at IBM these past two weeks has not only bridged the gap between my hobby and my professional prospects, but more importantly established friendships with professionals in the field of Software Development. Without a doubt this really great experience of an environment that rewards my enthusiasm will fondly stay in my mind as I enter the next chapter of my life!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Getting Suckered</h3>
<p>Last week a colleague of mine came up to me and showed me some of the
<abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> on PowerPC and asked why on earth does it fail
<a href="https://github.com/nlynch-mentor/vdsotest">vdsotest</a>. I should come
clean at this point and admit that I knew very little about the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr>
and hadn't heard of vdsotest. I had to admit to this colleague that I
had no idea everything looked super sane.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (for me) I got hooked, vdsotest was saying it was
getting '22' instead of '-1' and it was the case where the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> would
call into the kernel. It plagued me all night, 22 is so suspicious.
Right before I got to work the next morning I had an epiphany, "I bet
22 is EINVAL".</p>
<h3>Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSO"><abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr></a> is a mechanism to
expose some kernel functionality into userspace to avoid the cost of a
context switch into kernel mode. This is a great feat of engineering,
avoiding the context switch can have a dramatic speedup for userspace
code. Obviously not all kernel functionality can be placed into
userspace and even for the functionality which can,
there may be edge cases in which the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> needs to ask the kernel.</p>
<p>Who tests the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr>? For the portion that lies exclusively in userspace it
will escape all testing of the syscall interface which is really what
kernel developers are so focused on not breaking. Enter Nathan Lynch
with <a href="https://github.com/nlynch-mentor/vdsotest">vdsotest</a> who has
done some great work!</p>
<h3>The Kernel</h3>
<p>When the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> can't get the correct value without the kernel, it
simply calls into the kernel because the kernel is the definitive
reference for every syscall. On PowerPC something like this happens
(sorry, our <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> is 100% asm):

<p>For those not familiar, this couldn't be more simple. The start checks
to see if it is a clock id that the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> can handle and if not it jumps
to the 99 label. From here simply load the syscall number, jump to the
kernel and branch to link register aka 'return'.  In this case the
'return' statement would return to the userspace code which called the
<abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> function.</p>
<p>Wait, having the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> calling into the kernel call gets us the wrong
result? Or course it should, vdsotest is assuming a C ABI with return
values and errno but the kernel doesn't do that, the kernel ABI is
different. How does this even work on x86? Ohhhhh vdsotest does <sup id="fnref-2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>That little hack isn't working on PowerPC and here's why:</p>
<p>The kernel puts the return value in the ABI specified return register
(r3) and uses a condition register bit (condition register field 0, SO
bit), so unlike x86 on error the return value isn't negative. To make
matters worse, the condition register is very difficult to access from
C. Depending on your definition of 'access from C' you might consider
it impossible, a fixup like that would be impossible.</p>
<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> supplied functions aren't quite the same as their libc
counterparts. Unless you have very good reason, and to be fair,
vdsotest does have a very good reason, always access the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> through
libc</li>
<li>Kernel interfaces aren't C interfaces, yep, they're close but they
  aren't the same</li>
<li>22 is in fact EINVAL</li>
<li>Different architectures are... Different!</li>
<li>Variety is the spice of life</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S I have a hacky patch waiting review</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Continuous integration has changed the way we develop software.  The ability to make a code change and be notified quickly and automatically whether or not it works allows for faster iteration and higher quality.  These processes and technologies allow products to quickly and consistently release new versions, driving continuous improvement to their users.  For a web app, it's all pretty simple: write some tests, someone makes a pull request, you build it and run the tests.  Tools like GitHub, Travis CI and Jenkins have made this process simple and efficient.</p>
<p>Let's throw some spanners in the works.  What if instead of a desktop or web application, you're dealing with an operating system?  What if your tests can only be run when booted on physical hardware? What if instead of something like a GitHub pull request, code changes were sent as plain-text emails to a mailing list?  What if you didn't have control the development of this project, and you had to work with an existing, open community?</p>
<p>These are some of the problems faced by the Linux kernel, and many other open source projects.  Mailing lists, along with tools like <code>git send-email</code>, have become core development infrastructure for many large open source projects.  The idea of sending code via a plain-text email is simple and well-defined, not reliant on a proprietary service, and uses universal, well-defined technology.  It does have shortcomings, though.  How do you take a plain-text patch, which was sent as an email to a mailing list, and accomplish the continuous integration possibilities other tools have trivially?</p>
<p>Out of this problem birthed <a href="https://github.com/ruscur/snowpatch">snowpatch</a>, a continuous integration tool designed to enable these practices for projects that use mailing lists and plain-text patches.  By taking patch metadata organised by <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org">Patchwork</a>, performing a number of <code>git</code> operations and shipping them off to <a href="https://jenkins.io">Jenkins</a>, snowpatch can enable continuous integration for any mailing list-based project.  At IBM <a href="https://ozlabs.org">OzLabs</a>, we're using snowpatch to automatically test new patches for <a href="https://github.com/linuxppc/linux/">Linux on POWER</a>, <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot.git">skiboot</a>, snowpatch itself, and more.</p>
<p>snowpatch is written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>, an exciting new systems programming language with a focus on speed and safety.  Rust's amazing software ecosystem, enabled by its package manager <a href="https://crates.io">Cargo</a>, made development of snowpatch a breeze.  Using Rust has been a lot of fun, along with the practical benefits of (in our experience) faster development, and confidence in the runtime stability of our code.  It's still a young language, but it's quickly growing and has an amazing community that has always been happy to help.</p>
<p>We still have a lot of ideas for snowpatch that haven't been implemented yet.  Once we've tested a patch and sent the results back to a patchwork instance, what if the project's maintainer (or a trusted contributor) could manually trigger some more intensive tests?  How would we handle it if the traffic on the mailing list of a project is too fast for us to test?  If we were running snowpatch on multiple machines on the same project, how would we avoid duplicating effort?  These are unsolved problems, and if you'd like to help us with these or anything else you think would be good for snowpatch, we take contributions and ideas via our mailing list, which you can subscribe to <a href="https://lists.ozlabs.org/listinfo/snowpatch">here</a>.  For more details, view our documentation on <a href="https://github.com/ruscur/snowpatch">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking your time to learn a bit about snowpatch.  In future, we'll be talking about how we tie all these technologies together to build a continuous integration workflow for the Linux kernel and OpenPOWER firmware.  Watch this space!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am sadly coming to the end of my six(ish) month internship with Ozlabs (funded by <a href="https://www.acs.org.au">ACS</a>). So here I am writing about my experience in the hopes that future prospective interns can read about how they should come and work with the previously dubbed Linux Gods.</p>
<h3>What is your background?</h3>
<p>Despite embracing being a nerd at school, my opinion of computers prior to starting my Engineering degree was that they were boring and for geeky boys who didn't want to interact with the 'real' world. However when having to choose a specialisation of Engineering I was drawn towards Computer Systems as everything else seemed obvious * but Computer Systems was this great mystical unknown. </p>
<p>Fast forward three years, and I had seen glimpses into the workings of this magical computer world. I had learnt about transistors, logic gates and opamps; I had designed circuits that actually worked; and I had bashed my head against a wall trying to find obscure bugs. I had dabbled in a range of languages from the low levels of VHDL and embedded C, to the abstract world of Python and Java and delved into the obscure world of declarative prologs and relational reinforcement learning. Now it was time to solidify some of these concepts and get some experience under my belt so I could feel less like a monkey bashing random keys on my keyboard. Enter Ozlabs!</p>
<h3>What did you do at Ozlabs?</h3>
<p>After being handed a nice laptop and the root passwords, I faced the inevitable battle of getting everything setup. With the help of my mentor, the prestigious <a href="http://mpe.github.io/">Michael Ellerman</a>, and various other Ozlabs residents I picked off some low hanging fruit such as removing unused code and tidying up a few things. This allowed me to get familiar with the open-source workflow, the kernel building process, IRC, do more with Git then just push and pull, and <strong>finally</strong> come face-to-face with the seemingly impossible: Vim and virtual machines.</p>
<p>I then got to learn about Transactional Memory (TM) - a way of making a bunch of instructions on one processor appear to be one atomic operation to other processors. I took some old TM tests from Mikey and checked that they did indeed pass and fail when they were supposed to and refurbished them a little, learning how to run kernel self-tests and a bit about powerpc assembly along the way.</p>
<p>Eventually my fear of shell scripts was no match for my desire to be able to build and install a kernel with one command and so I finally got around to writing a build script. Accidentally rebooting a bare-metal machine instead of my VM running on it may have had a significant contribution to this...</p>
<p>The next interesting task I got to tackle was to implement a virtual memory dump that other architectures like x86 have, so we can see how the pages in memory are laid out along with information about these pages. This involved understanding x86's implementation and relating that to POWER's memory management. At Uni I never quite understood the fuss about pages and virtual memory and so it was great to be able to build up an appreciation and play around with page tables, virtual to real addresses, and hashtable.</p>
<p>I then moved onto <a href="https://sthbrx.github.io/blog/2016/05/13/srop-mitigation/">SROP mitigation</a>! After a lot of reading and re-reading, I decided to first understand how to use SROP to make an exploit on POWER which meant some assembly, diving into the signal code and finally meeting and spending time with GDB.  Once again I had x86 code to port over to POWER, the main issue being making sure that I didn't break existing things - aka hours and hours of running the kernel self-tests and the Linux Test Project tests and some more scripting, with the help of <a href="http://blog.christophersmart.com/">Chris Smart</a>, to collate the results.</p>
<p>You can judge all my submitted patches <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?submitter=67695&amp;state=*">here</a>.</p>
<h3>What was your overall experience like at Ozlabs?</h3>
<p>I moved to Canberra shortly after finishing exams and so hadn't had the time to ponder expectations of Ozlabs. Everyone was super friendly and despite being, not just the only female but, the only kiwi among a whoooole lot of Aussies I experienced a distinct lack of discrimination (apart from a bit of banter about accents).</p>
<p>Could I wear my normal clothes (and not stuffy business clothes)? Check. Did I get to work on interesting things? Check. Could I do my work without having to go through lots of unnecessary hoops and what not? Check. Could I develop my own workflow and learn all the things? Check. Did I get to delve into a few different areas? Check. Was I surrounded by super smart people who were willing to help me learn? Check. </p>
<p>All in all, I have had a great time here, learnt so much and you should definitely come and work at Ozlabs! Hopefully you'll see me back on this blog in a few months :)</p>
<p>* <em>My pre-university, perhaps somewhat naiive, opinion: Civil and Mechanical is just physics. Chemical and Materials is just chemistry. Electrical seems interesting but who wants to work with power lines? Biomedical is just math and biology. Software is just abstract high level nonsense. But how a computer works?? That is some magical stuff.</em></p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> is a text editor.  It's new, it's shiny, and it has a lot of good and bad sides.  I work in a lab full of kernel developers, and in the kernel, there are no IDEs.  There's no real metadata you can get out of your compiler (given the kernel isn't very clang friendly), there's certainly nothing like that you can get out of your build system, so "plain old" text editors reign supreme.  It's a vim or Emacs show.</p>
<p>And so Atom comes along.  Unlike other shiny new text editors to emerge in the past 10 or so years, it's open source (unlike Sublime Text), it works well on Linux, and it's very configurable.  When it first came out, Atom was an absolute mess.  There was a noticeable delay whenever you typed a key.  That has gone, but the sour impression that comes from replacing a native application with a web browser in a frame remains.</p>
<p>Like the curious person I am, I'm always trying out new things to see if they're any good.  I'm not particularly tied to any editor; I prefer modal editing, but I'm no vim wizard.  I eventually settled on using Emacs with evil-mode (which I assumed would make both Emacs and vim people like me, but the opposite happened), which was decent.  It was configurable, it was good, but it had issues.</p>
<p><img alt="The Atom editor" src="/images/ruscur/36lOiMT.png"></p>
<p>So, let's have a look at how Atom stacks up for low-level work.  First of all, it's X only.  You wouldn't use it to change one line of a file in /etc/, and a lot of kernel developers only edit code inside a terminal emulator.  Most vim people do this since gvim is a bit wonky, and Emacs people can double-dip; using Emacs without X for small things and Emacs with X for programming.  You don't want to do that with Atom, if nothing else because of its slow startup time.</p>
<p>Now let's look at configurability.  In my opinion, no editor will ever match the level of configurability of Emacs, however the barrier to entry is much lower here.  Atom has lots of options exposed in a config file, and you can set them there or you can use an equivalent GUI.  In addition, a perk of being a browser in a frame is that you can customise a lot of UI things with CSS, for those inclined.  Overall, I'd say Emacs &gt; Atom &gt; vim here, but for a newbie, it's probably Atom &gt; Emacs &gt; vim.</p>
<p>Okay, package management.  Atom is the clear winner here.  The package repository is very easy to use, for users and developers.  I wrote my own package, typed <code>apm publish</code> and within a minute a friend could install it.  For kernel development though, you don't really need to install anything, Atom is pretty batteries-included.  This includes good syntax highlighting, ctags support, and a few themes.  In this respect, Atom feels like an editor that was created this century.</p>
<p><img alt="Atom's inbuilt package management" src="/images/ruscur/DAx7GqD.png"></p>
<p>What about actually editing text?  Well, I only use modal editing, and Atom is very far from being the best vim.  I think evil-mode in Emacs is the best vim, followed closely by vim itself.  Atom has a vim-mode, and it's fine for insert/normal/visual mode, but anything involving a : is a no-go.  There's a plugin that's entirely useless.  If I tried to do a replacement with :s, Atom would lock up <em>and</em> fail to replace the text.  vim replaced thousands of occurrences with in a second.  Other than that, Atom's pretty good.  I can move around pretty much just as well as I could in vim or Emacs, but not quite.  Also, it support ligatures!  The first kernel-usable editor that does.</p>
<p>Autocompletions feel very good in Atom.  It completes within a local scope automatically, without any knowledge of the type of file you're working on.  As far as intelligence goes, Atom's support for tags outside of ctags is very lacking, and ctags is stupid.  Go-to definition <em>sometimes</em> works, but it lags when dealing with something as big as the Linux kernel.  Return-from definition is very good, though.  Another downside is that it can complete from any open buffer, which is a huge problem if you're writing Rust in one tab and C in the other.</p>
<p><img alt="Atom's fuzzy file matching is pretty good" src="/images/ruscur/0PRiIUS.png"></p>
<p>An experience I've had with Atom that I haven't had with other editors is actually writing a plugin.  It was really easy, mostly because I stole a lot of it from an existing plugin, but it was easy.  I wrote a syntax highlighting package for POWER assembly, which was much more fighting with regular expressions than it was fighting with anything in Atom.  Once I had it working, it was very easy to publish; just push to GitHub and run a command.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Atom can get too clever for its own good.  For some completely insane reason, it automatically "fixes" whitespace in every file you open, leading to a huge amount of git changes you didn't intend.  That's easy to disable, but I don't want my editor doing that, it'd be much better if it highlighted whitespace it didn't like by default, like you can get vim and Emacs to do.  For an editor designed around git, I can't comprehend that decision.</p>
<p><img alt="Atom can also fuzzy match its commands" src="/images/ruscur/arbWXHx.png"></p>
<p>Speaking of git, the editor pretty much has everything you'd expect for an editor written at GitHub.  The sidebar shows you what lines you've added, removed and modified, and the gutter shows you what branch you're on and how much you've changed all-up.  There's no in-built support for doing git things inside the editor, but there's a package for it.  It's pretty nice to get something "for free" that you'd have to tinker with in other editors.</p>
<p>Overall, Atom has come a long way and still has a long way to go.  I've been using it for a few weeks and I'll continue to use it.  I'll encourage new developers to use it, but it needs to be better for experienced programmers who are used to their current workflow to consider switching.  If you're in the market for a new editor, Atom might just be for you.</p></div>
