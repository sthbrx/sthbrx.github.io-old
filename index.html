  <div class="entry-content"><p>On my team, we do two different things in our Continuous Integration setup: build/functional tests, and performance tests. Build tests are simply testing whether a project builds, and if it provides a functional test suite, that the tests pass. We do a lot of MySQL/MariaDB testing this way. The other type of testing we do is performance tests: we build a project and then run a set of benchmarks against it. Python is a good example here.</p>
<p>Build tests want as much grunt as possible. Performance tests, on the other hand, want a stable, isolated environment. Initially, we set up Jenkins so that when a performance and build tests never ran at the same time. Builds would get the entire machine, and performance tests would never have to share with anyone.</p>
<p>This, while simple and effective, has some downsides. In POWER land, our machines are quite beefy. For example, one of the boxes I use - an S822L - has 4 sockets, each with 4 cores. At SMT-8 (an 8 way split of each core) that gives us 4 x 4 x 8 = 128 threads. It seems wasteful to lock this entire machine - all 128 threads - just so as to isolate a single-threaded test.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>So, <strong>can we partition our machine so that we can be running two different sorts of processes in a sufficiently isolated way?</strong></p>
<p>What counts as 'sufficiently isolated'? Well, my performance tests are CPU bound, so I want CPU isolation. I also want memory, and in particular memory bandwith to be isolated. I don't particularly care about IO isolation as my tests aren't IO heavy. Lastly, I have a couple of tests that are very multithreaded, so I'd like to have enough of a machine for those test results to be interesting.</p>
<p>For CPU isolation we have CPU affinity. We can also do something similar with memory. On a POWER8 system, memory is connected to individual P8s, not to some central point. This is a 'Non-Uniform Memory Architecture' (NUMA) setup: the directly attached memory will be very fast for a processor to access, and memory attached to other processors will be slower to access. A accessible guide (with very helpful diagrams!) is <a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redpapers/pdfs/redp5098.pdf">the relevant RedBook (PDF)</a>, chapter 2.</p>
<p>We could achieve the isolation we want by dividing up CPUs and NUMA nodes between the competing workloads. Fortunately, all of the hardware NUMA information is plumbed nicely into Linux. Each P8 socket gets a corresponding NUMA node. <code>lscpu</code> will tell you what CPUs correspond to which NUMA nodes (although what it calls a CPU we would call a hardware thread). If you install <code>numactl</code>, you can use <code>numactl -H</code> to get even more details.</p>
<p>In our case, the relevant <code>lscpu</code> output is thus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0-31
NUMA node1 CPU(s):     96-127
NUMA node16 CPU(s):    32-63
NUMA node17 CPU(s):    64-95
</pre></div>


<p>Now all we have to do is find some way to tell Linux to restrict a group of processes to a particular NUMA node and the corresponding CPUs. How? Enter control groups, or <code>cgroups</code> for short. Processes can be put into a cgroup, and then a cgroup controller can control the resouces allocated to the cgroup. Cgroups are hierarchical, and there are controllers for a number of different ways you could control a group of processes. Most helpfully for us, there's one called <code>cpuset</code>, which can control CPU affinity, and restrict memory allocation to a NUMA node.</p>
<p>We then just have to get the processes into the relevant cgroup. Fortunately, Docker is incredibly helpful for this!<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Docker containers are put in the <code>docker</code> cgroup. Each container gets it's own cgroup under the docker cgroup, and fortunately Docker deals well with the somewhat broken state of cpuset inheritance.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> So it suffices to create a cpuset cgroup for docker, and allocate some resources to it, and Docker will do the rest. Here we'll allocate the last 3 sockets and NUMA nodes to Docker containers:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>cgcreate -g cpuset:docker
<span class="nb">echo</span> 32-127 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/docker/cpuset.cpus
<span class="nb">echo</span> 1,16-17 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/docker/cpuset.mems
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="m">1</span> &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/docker/cpuset.mem_hardwall
</pre></div>


<p><code>mem_hardwall</code> prevents memory allocations under docker from spilling over into the one remaining NUMA node.</p>
<p>So, does this work? I created a container with sysbench and then ran the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>root@0d3f339d4181:/# sysbench --test<span class="o">=</span>cpu --num-threads<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">128</span> --max-requests<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">10000000</span> run
</pre></div>


<p>Now I've asked for 128 threads, but the cgroup only has CPUs/hwthreads 32-127 allocated. So If I run htop, I shouldn't see any load on CPUs 0-31. What do I actually see?</p>
<p><img alt="htop screenshot, showing load only on CPUs 32-127" src="images/dja/cgroup1.png" /></p>
<p>It works! Now, we create a cgroup for performance tests using the first socket and NUMA node:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>cgcreate -g cpuset:perf-cgroup
<span class="nb">echo</span> 0-31 &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/perf-cgroup/cpuset.cpus
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="m">0</span> &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/perf-cgroup/cpuset.mems
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="m">1</span> &gt; /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/perf-cgroup/cpuset.mem_hardwall
</pre></div>


<p>Docker conveniently lets us put new containers under a different cgroup, which means we can simply do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>dja@p88 ~&gt; docker run -it --rm --cgroup-parent<span class="o">=</span>/perf-cgroup/ ppc64le/ubuntu bash
root@b037049f94de:/# <span class="c1"># ... install sysbench</span>
root@b037049f94de:/# sysbench --test<span class="o">=</span>cpu --num-threads<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">128</span> --max-requests<span class="o">=</span><span class="m">10000000</span> run
</pre></div>


<p>And the result?</p>
<p><img alt="htop screenshot, showing load only on CPUs 0-31" src="images/dja/cgroup2.png" /></p>
<p>It works! My benchmark results also suggest this is sufficient isolation, and the rest of the team is happy to have more build resources to play with.</p>
<p>There are some boring loose ends to tie up: if a build job does anything outside of docker (like clone a git repo), that doesn't come under the docker cgroup, and we have to interact with systemd. Because systemd doesn't know about cpuset, this is <em>quite</em> fiddly. We also want this in a systemd unit so it runs on start up, and we want some code to tear it down. But I'll spare you the gory details.</p>
<p>In summary, cgroups are surprisingly powerful and simple to work with, especially in conjunction with Docker and NUMA on Power!</p>
<div class="footnote">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>It gets worse! Before the performance test starts, all the running build jobs must drain. If we have 8 Jenkins executors running on the box, and a performance test job is the next in the queue, we have to wait for 8 running jobs to clear. If they all started at different times and have different runtimes, we will inevitably spend a fair chunk of time with the machine at less than full utilisation while we're waiting.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I hear this is getting better. It is also why systemd hasn't done cpuset inheritance yet.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>POWER8 sounds great, but where the heck can I get a Power VM so I can test my code?</em></p>
<p>This is a common question we get at OzLabs from other open source developers looking to port their software to the Power Architecture. Unfortunately, most developers don't have one of our amazing servers just sitting around under their desk.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's a few IBM partners who offer free VMs for development use. If you're in need of a development VM, check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://openpower.ic.unicamp.br/minicloud/">MiniCloud</a>, hosted by the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), Brazil</li>
<li><a href="http://osuosl.org/services/powerdev">OSU Open Source Lab</a>, hosted by the Oregon State University</li>
<li><a href="https://ptopenlab.com/cloudlabconsole">SuperVessel Cloud for Power/OpenPOWER</a>, hosted by IBM China</li>
</ul>
<p>So, next time you wonder how you can test your project on POWER8, request a VM and get to it!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Generally when someone wants to install a Linux distro they start with an ISO
file. Now we could burn that to a DVD, walk into the server room, and put it in
our machine, but that's a pain. Instead let's look at how to do this over the
network with Petitboot!</p>
<p>At the moment Petitboot won't be able to handle an ISO file unless it's
mounted in an expected place (eg. as a mounted DVD), so we need to unpack it
somewhere. Choose somewhere to host the result and unpack the ISO via whatever
method you prefer. (For example <code>bsdtar -xf /path/to/image.iso</code>).</p>
<p>You'll get a bunch of files but for our purposes we only care about a few; the
kernel, the initrd, and the bootloader configuration file. Using
the Ubuntu 16.04 ppc64el ISO as an example, these are:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>./install/vmlinux
./install/initrd.gz.
./boot/grub/grub.cfg
</pre></div>


<p>In grub.cfg we can see that the boot arguments are actually quite simple:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>set timeout=-1

menuentry &quot;Install&quot; {
    linux   /install/vmlinux tasks=standard pkgsel/language-pack-patterns= pkgsel/install-language-support=false --- quiet
    initrd  /install/initrd.gz
}

menuentry &quot;Rescue mode&quot; {
    linux   /install/vmlinux rescue/enable=true --- quiet
    initrd  /install/initrd.gz
}
</pre></div>


<p>So all we need to do is create a PXE config file that points Petitboot towards
the correct files.</p>
<p>We're going to create a PXE config file which you could serve from your DHCP
server, but that does not mean we need to use PXE - if you just want a quick
install you only need make these files accessible to Petitboot, and then we can
use the 'Retrieve config from URL' option to download the files.</p>
<p>Create a petitboot.conf file somewhere accessible that contains (for Ubuntu):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>label Install Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial Xerus
    kernel http://myaccesibleserver/path/to/vmlinux
    initrd http://myaccesibleserver/path/to/initrd.gz
    append tasks=standard pkgsel/language-pack-patterns= pkgsel/install-language-support=false --- quiet
</pre></div>


<p>Then in Petitboot, select 'Retrieve config from URL' and enter
<code>http://myaccesibleserver/path/to/petitboot.conf</code>. In the main menu your new
option should appear - select it and away you go!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a hobbyist programmer and Linux user, I was pretty stoked to be able to experience real work in the IT field that interests me most, Linux. With a mainly disconnected understanding of computer hardware and software, I braced myself to entirely relearn everything and anything I thought I knew. Furthermore, I worried that my usefulness in a world of maintainers, developers and testers would not be enough to provide any real contribution to the company. In actual fact however, the employees at OzLabs (IBM ADL) put a really great effort into making use of my existing skills, were attentive to my current knowledge and just filled in the gaps! The knowledge they've given me is practical, interlinked with hardware and provided me with the foot-up that I'd been itching for to establish my own portfolio as a programmer. I was both honoured and astonished by their dedication to helping me make a truly meaningful contribution!</p>
<p>On applying for the placement, I listed my skills and interests. Having a Mathematics, Science background, I listed among my greatest interests development of scientific simulation and graphics using libraries such as Python matplotlib and R. By the <em>first day</em> they got me to work, researching and implementing a routine in R that would qualitatively model the ability of a system to perform common tasks - a benchmark. A series of these microbenchmarks were made; I was in my element and actually able to contribute to a corporation much larger than I could imagine. The team at IBM reinforced my knowledge from the ground up, introducing the rigorous hardware and corporate elements at a level I was comfortable with.</p>
<p>I would say that my greatest single piece of take-home knowledge over the two weeks was knowledge of the Linux Kernel project, Git and GitHub. Having met the arch/powerpc and linux-next maintainers in person placed the Linux and Open Source development cycle in an entirely new perspective. I was introduced to the world of GitHub, and thanks to a few rigorous lessons of Git, I now have access to tools that empower me to safely and efficiently write code, and to build a public portfolio I can be proud of. Most members of the office donated their time to instruct me on all fronts, whether to do with career paths, programming expertise or conceptual knowledge, and the rest were all very good for a chat.</p>
<p>Approaching the tail-end of Year Twelve, I was blessed with some really good feedback and recommendations regarding further study. If during the two weeks I had any query regarding anything ranging from work-life to programming expertise even to which code editor I should use (a source of much contention) the people in the office were very happy to help me. Several employees donated their time to teach me really very intensive and long lessons regarding the software development concepts, including (but not limited to!) a thorough and helpful lesson on Git that was just on my level of understanding.</p>
<p>Working at IBM these past two weeks has not only bridged the gap between my hobby and my professional prospects, but more importantly established friendships with professionals in the field of Software Development. Without a doubt this really great experience of an environment that rewards my enthusiasm will fondly stay in my mind as I enter the next chapter of my life!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Getting Suckered</h3>
<p>Last week a colleague of mine came up to me and showed me some of the
<abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> on PowerPC and asked why on earth does it fail
<a href="https://github.com/nlynch-mentor/vdsotest">vdsotest</a>. I should come
clean at this point and admit that I knew very little about the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr>
and hadn't heard of vdsotest. I had to admit to this colleague that I
had no idea everything looked super sane.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (for me) I got hooked, vdsotest was saying it was
getting '22' instead of '-1' and it was the case where the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> would
call into the kernel. It plagued me all night, 22 is so suspicious.
Right before I got to work the next morning I had an epiphany, "I bet
22 is EINVAL".</p>
<h3>Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSO"><abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr></a> is a mechanism to
expose some kernel functionality into userspace to avoid the cost of a
context switch into kernel mode. This is a great feat of engineering,
avoiding the context switch can have a dramatic speedup for userspace
code. Obviously not all kernel functionality can be placed into
userspace and even for the functionality which can,
there may be edge cases in which the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> needs to ask the kernel.</p>
<p>Who tests the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr>? For the portion that lies exclusively in userspace it
will escape all testing of the syscall interface which is really what
kernel developers are so focused on not breaking. Enter Nathan Lynch
with <a href="https://github.com/nlynch-mentor/vdsotest">vdsotest</a> who has
done some great work!</p>
<h3>The Kernel</h3>
<p>When the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> can't get the correct value without the kernel, it
simply calls into the kernel because the kernel is the definitive
reference for every syscall. On PowerPC something like this happens
(sorry, our <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> is 100% asm):

<p>For those not familiar, this couldn't be more simple. The start checks
to see if it is a clock id that the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> can handle and if not it jumps
to the 99 label. From here simply load the syscall number, jump to the
kernel and branch to link register aka 'return'.  In this case the
'return' statement would return to the userspace code which called the
<abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> function.</p>
<p>Wait, having the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> calling into the kernel call gets us the wrong
result? Or course it should, vdsotest is assuming a C ABI with return
values and errno but the kernel doesn't do that, the kernel ABI is
different. How does this even work on x86? Ohhhhh vdsotest does <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>That little hack isn't working on PowerPC and here's why:</p>
<p>The kernel puts the return value in the ABI specified return register
(r3) and uses a condition register bit (condition register field 0, SO
bit), so unlike x86 on error the return value isn't negative. To make
matters worse, the condition register is very difficult to access from
C. Depending on your definition of 'access from C' you might consider
it impossible, a fixup like that would be impossible.</p>
<h3>Lessons learnt</h3>
<ul>
<li><abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> supplied functions aren't quite the same as their libc
counterparts. Unless you have very good reason, and to be fair,
vdsotest does have a very good reason, always access the <abbr title="Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects">vDSO</abbr> through
libc</li>
<li>Kernel interfaces aren't C interfaces, yep, they're close but they
  aren't the same</li>
<li>22 is in fact EINVAL</li>
<li>Different architectures are... Different!</li>
<li>Variety is the spice of life</li>
</ul>
<p>P.S I have a hacky patch waiting review</p>
