  <div class="entry-content"><p>A Google search for 'Petitboot' brings up results from a number of places, some describing its use on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/linuxonibm/liabp/liabppetitboot.htm">POWER servers</a>, others talking about how to use it on the <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/petitboot/">PS3</a>, in varying levels of detail. I tend to get a lot of general questions about Petitboot and its behaviour, and have had a few requests for a broad "Welcome to Petitboot" blog, suggesting that existing docs deal with more specific topics.. or that people just aren't reading them :)</p>
<p>So today we're going to take a bit of a crash course in the what, why, and possibly how of Petitboot. I won't delve too much into technical details, and this will be focussed on Petitboot in POWER land since that's where I spend most of my time.
Here we go!</p>
<h2>What</h2>
<p>Aside from a whole lot of firmware and kernel logs flying past, the first thing you'll see when booting a POWER server<sup>In OPAL mode at least...</sup> is Petitboot's main menu:</p>
<p><img alt="Main Menu" src="/images/sammj/mainmenu.png"></p>
<p>Petitboot is the first interact-able component a user will see. The word 'BIOS' gets thrown around a lot when discussing this area, but that is wrong, and the people using that word are wrong.</p>
<p>When the OPAL firmware layer <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a> has finished its own set up, it loads a certain binary (stored on the BMC) into memory and jumps into it. This could hypothetically be anything, but for any POWER server right now it is 'Skiroot'. Skiroot is a full Linux kernel and userspace, which runs Petitboot. People often say Petitboot when they mean Skiroot - technically Petitboot is the server and UI processes that happen to run within Skiroot, and Skiroot is the full kernel and rootfs package. This is more obvious when you look at the <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">op-build</a> project - Petitboot is a package built as part of the kernel and rootfs created by Buildroot.</p>
<p>Petitboot is made of two major parts - the UI processes (one for each available console), and the 'discover' server. The discover server updates the UI processes, manages and scans available disks and network devices, and performs the actual booting of host operating systems. The UI, running in ncurses, displays these options, allows the user to edit boot options and system configuration, and tells the server which boot option to kexec.</p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<p>The 'why' delves into some of the major architectural differences between a POWER machine and your average x86 machine which, as always, could spread over several blog posts and/or a textbook.</p>
<p>POWER processors don't boot themselves, instead the attached Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) does a lot of low-level poking that gets the primary processor into a state where it is ready to execute instructions. PowerVM systems would then jump directly into the PHYP hypervisor - any subsequent OS, be it AIX or Linux, would then run as a 'partition' under this hypervisor.</p>
<p>What we all really want though is to run Linux directly on the hardware, which meant a new boot process would have to be thought up while still maintaining compatibility with PowerVM so systems could be booted in either mode. Thus became OPAL, and its implementation <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">Skiboot</a>. Skipping over <em>so much</em> detail, the system ends up booting into Skiboot which acts as our firmware layer. Skiboot isn't interactive and doesn't really care about things like disks, so it loads another binary into memory and executes it - Skiroot!</p>
<p>Skiroot exists as an alternative to writing a whole new bootloader just for POWER in OPAL mode, or going through the effort to port an existing bootloader to understand the specifics of POWER. Why do all that when Linux already exists and already knows how to handle disks, network interfaces, and a thousand other things? Not to mention that when Linux gains support for fancy new devices so do we, and adding new features of our own is as simple as writing your average Linux program.</p>
<p>Skiroot itself (not including Skiboot) is roughly comparable to UEFI, or at least much more so than legacy BIOS implementations. But whereas UEFI tends to be a monolithic blob of fairly platform-specific code (in practice), Skiroot is simply a small Linux environment that anyone could put together with Buildroot.</p>
<p>A much better insight into the development and motivation behind Skiroot and Petitboot is available in Jeremy's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxmMJMibZQ8">LCA2013 talk</a></p>
<h2>Back to Petitboot</h2>
<p>Petitboot is the part of the 'bootloader' that <em>did</em> need to be written, because users probably wouldn't be too thrilled if they had to manually mount disks and kexec their kernels every time they booted the machine. The Petitboot server process mounts any available disk devices and scans them for available operating systems. That's not to say that it scans the entire disk, because otherwise you could be waiting for quite some time, but rather it looks in a list of common locations for bootloader configuration files. This is handy because it means the operating system doesn't need to have any knowledge of Petitboot - it just uses its usual install scripts and Petitboot reads them to know what is available.
At the same time Petitboot makes PXE requests on configured network interfaces so we can netboot, and allows these various sources to be given relative priorities for auto-boot, plus a number of other ways to specially configure booting behaviour.</p>
<p>A particularly neat feature of existing in a Linux environment is the ability to easily recover from boot problems; whereas on another system you might need to use a Live CD to fix a misconfiguration or recover a broken filesystem, in Skiroot you can just drop to the shell and fix the issue right there.</p>
<p>In summary, Petitboot/Skiroot is a small but capable Linux environment that every OPAL POWER machine boots into, gathering up all the various local and remote boot possibilities, and presenting them to you in a state-of-the-art ncurses interface. Petitboot updates all the time, and if you come across a feature that you think Petitboot is missing, patches are very welcome at <a href="mailto:petitboot@lists.ozlabs.org">petitboot@lists.ozlabs.org</a> (or hassle me on IRC)!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It started off a regular Wednesday morning when I hear from my desk a colleague
muttering about doubles and their hex representation. "But that doesn't look
right", "How do I read this as a float", and "<del>redacted</del> you're the engineer,
you do it". My interest piqued, I headed over to his desk to enquire about the
great un-solvable mystery of the double and its hex representation. The number
which would consume me for the rest of the morning: 0xc00000001568fba0.</p>
<h2>That's a Perfectly Valid hex Number!</h2>
<p>I hear you say. And you're right, if we were to treat this as a long it
would simply be 13835058055641365408 (or -4611686018068186208 if we assume
a signed value). But we happen to know that this particular piece of data which
we have printed is supposed to represent a double (-2 to be precise). "Well
print it as a double" I hear from the back, and once again we <em>should</em> all know
that this can be achieved rather easily by using the %f/%e/%g specifiers in our
print statement. The only problem is that in kernel land (where we use printk)
we are limited to printing fixed point numbers, hence why our only <em>easy</em>
option was to print our double in it's raw hex format.</p>
<p>This is the point where we all think back to that university course where
number representations were covered in depth, and terms like 'mantissa' and
'exponent' surface in our minds. Of course as we rack our brains we realise
there's no way that we're going to remember exactly how a double is represented
and bring up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format">IEEE 754 Wikipedia page</a>.</p>
<h2>What is a Double?</h2>
<p>Taking a step back for a second, a double (or a double-precision floating-point)
is a number format used to represent floating-point numbers (those with a
decimal component). They are made up of a sign bit, an exponent and a fraction
(or mantissa):</p>
<p><img alt="Double Format" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/double.png"></p>
<p>Where the number they represent is defined by:</p>
<p><img alt="Double Formula" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/formula.png"></p>
<p>So this means that a 1 in the MSB (sign bit) represents a negative number, and
we have some decimal component (the fraction) which we multiply by some power
of 2 (as determined by the exponent) to get our value.</p>
<h2>Alright, so what's 0xc00000001568fba0?</h2>
<p>The reason we're all here to be begin with, so what's 0xc00000001568fba0 if we
treat it as a double? We can first split it into the three components:</p>
<h5>0xc00000001568fba0:</h5>
<p>Sign bit: 1             -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400         -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x1568fba0    -&gt; 1.<em>something</em><br></p>
<p>And then use the formula above to get our number:</p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>something</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup></p>
<p><strong>But there's a much easier way!</strong> Just write ourselves a little program in
userspace (where we are capable of printing floats) and we can save ourselves
<em>most</em> of the trouble.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">#include</span> <span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span class="cp"></span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">long</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mh">0xc00000001568fba0</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: %lf</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So all we're doing is taking our hex value and storing it in a long (val), then
getting a pointer to val, casting it to a double pointer, and dereferencing it
and printing it as a float. <em><strong>Drum Roll</strong></em> And the answer is?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: -2.000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Wait a minute, that doesn't quite sound right". You're right, it does seem a
bit strange that this is exactly -2. Well it may be that we are not printing
enough decimal places to see the full result, so update our print statement to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: %.64lf</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">double</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And now we get:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: -2.0000001595175973534423974342644214630126953125000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much better... But still where did this number come from and why wasn't it the
-2 that we were expecting?</p>
<h2>Kernel Pointers</h2>
<p>At this point suspicions had been raised that what was being printed by my
colleague was not what he expected and that this was in fact a Kernel pointer.
How do you know? Lets take a step back for a second...</p>
<p>In the PowerPC architecture, the address space which can be seen by an
application is known as the <em>effective</em> address space. We can take this
and translate it into a <em>virtual</em> address which when mapped through the
HPT (hash page table) gives us a <em>real</em> address (or the hardware memory address).</p>
<p>The <em>effective</em> address space is divided into 5 regions:</p>
<p><img alt="Effective Address Table" src="/images/surajjs/doubles_in_hex/effective_address.png"></p>
<p>As you may notice, Kernel addresses begin with 0xc. This has the advantage that
we can map a <em>virtual</em> address without the need for a table by simply
masking the top nibble.</p>
<p>Thus it would be reasonable to assume that our value (0xc00000001568fba0) was
indeed a pointer to a Kernel address (and further code investigation confirmed
this).</p>
<h2>But What is -2 as a Double in hex?</h2>
<p>Well lets modify the above program and find out:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">include</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">stdio</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>

        <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;val: 0x%lx</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">((</span><span class="kt">long</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">val</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Result?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"val: 0xc000000000000000"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that sounds much better. Lets take a closer look:</p>
<h5>0xc000000000000000:</h5>
<p>Sign Bit: 1     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400 -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x0   -&gt; Zero<br></p>
<p>So if you remember from above, we have:</p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>0</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -2</p>
<p>What about -1? -3?</p>
<h4>-1:</h4>
<h5>0xbff0000000000000:</h5>
<p>Sign Bit: 1     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x3ff -&gt; 2<sup>(1023 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x0   -&gt; Zero<br></p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>0</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1023 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -1</p>
<h4>-3:</h4>
<h5>0xc008000000000000:</h5>
<p>Sign Bit: 1                     -&gt; Negative<br>
Exponent: 0x400                 -&gt; 2<sup>(1024 - 1023)</sup><br>
Fraction: 0x8000000000000       -&gt; 0.5<br></p>
<p>(-1)<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> x 1.<em><strong>5</strong></em> x 2<sup><strong>(1024 - 1023)</strong></sup> = -3</p>
<h2>So What Have We Learnt?</h2>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong>, make sure that what you're printing is what you think you're printing.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, if it looks like a Kernel pointer then you're probably not printing
what you think you're printing.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly</strong>, all Kernel pointers ~= -2 if you treat them as a double.</p>
<p>And <strong>Finally</strong>, <em>with my morning gone</em>, I can say for certain that if we treat it as
a double, 0xc00000001568fba0 =
-2.0000001595175973534423974342644214630126953125.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here at OzLabs, we have an unfortunate habit of making our shiny Power computers very sad, which is a common problem in systems programming and kernel hacking. When this happens, we like having logs. In particular, we like to have the kernel log and the OPAL firmware log, which are, very surprisingly, rather helpful when debugging kernel and firmware issues.</p>
<p>Here's how to get them.</p>
<h2>From userspace</h2>
<p>You're lucky enough that your machine is still up, yay! As every Linux sysadmin knows, you can just grab the kernel log using <code>dmesg</code>.</p>
<p>As for the OPAL log: we can simply ask OPAL to tell us where its log is located in memory, copy it from there, and hand it over to userspace. In Linux, as per standard Unix conventions, we do this by exposing the log as a file, which can be found in <code>/sys/firmware/opal/msglog</code>.</p>
<p>Annoyingly, the <code>msglog</code> file reports itself as size 0 (I'm not sure exactly why, but I <em>think</em> it's due to limitations in sysfs), so if you try to copy the file with <code>cp</code>, you end up with just a blank file. However, you can read it with <code>cat</code> or <code>less</code>.</p>
<h2>From <code>xmon</code></h2>
<p><code>xmon</code> is a really handy in-kernel debugger for PowerPC that allows you to do basic debugging over the console without hooking up a second machine to use with <code>kgdb</code>. On our development systems, we often configure <code>xmon</code> to automatically begin debugging whenever we hit an oops or panic (using <code>xmon=on</code> on the kernel command line, or the <code>XMON_DEFAULT</code> Kconfig option). It can also be manually triggered:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>root@p86:~# echo x &gt; /proc/sysrq-trigger

<p>From <code>xmon</code>, simply type <code>dl</code> to dump out the kernel log. If you'd like to page through the log rather than dump the entire thing at once, use <code>#&lt;n&gt;</code> to split it into groups of <code>n</code> lines.</p>
<p>Until recently, it wasn't as easy to extract the OPAL log without knowing magic offsets. A couple of months ago, I was debugging a nasty CAPI issue and got rather frustrated by this, so one day when I had a couple of hours free I <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/581775/">refactored</a> the existing sysfs interface and <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/581774/">added</a> the <code>do</code> command to <code>xmon</code>. These patches will be included from kernel 4.6-rc1 onwards.</p>
<p>When you're done, <code>x</code> will attempt to recover the machine and continue, <code>zr</code> will reboot, and <code>zh</code> will halt.</p>
<h2>From the FSP</h2>
<p>Sometimes, not even <code>xmon</code> will help you. In production environments, you're not generally going to start a debugger every time you have an incident. Additionally, a serious hardware error can cause a 'checkstop', which completely halts the system. (Thankfully, end users don't see this very often, but kernel developers, on the other hand...)</p>
<p>This is where the Flexible Service Processor, or FSP, comes in. The FSP is an IBM-developed baseboard management controller used on most IBM-branded Power Systems machines, and is responsible for a whole range of things, including monitoring system health. Among its many capabilities, the FSP can automatically take "system dumps" when fatal errors occur, capturing designated regions of memory for later debugging. System dumps can be configured and triggered via the FSP's web interface, which is beyond the scope of this post but is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER8/p8ha5/mainstoragedump.htm?cp=POWER8%2F1-3-14-2">documented</a> in IBM Power Systems user manuals.</p>
<p>How does the FSP know what to capture? As it turns out, skiboot (the firmware which implements OPAL) maintains a <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/hw/fsp/fsp-mdst-table.c">Memory Dump Source Table</a> which tells the FSP which memory regions to dump. MDST updates are recorded in the OPAL log:</p>

<p>In the above log, we see four entries: the skiboot/OPAL log, the <a href="https://github.com/open-power/hostboot">hostboot</a> runtime log, the petitboot Linux kernel log (which doesn't make it into the final dump) and the real Linux kernel log. skiboot obviously adds the OPAL and hostboot logs to the MDST early in boot, but it also exposes the <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/doc/opal-api/opal-register-dump-region-101.txt"><code>OPAL_REGISTER_DUMP_REGION</code></a> call which can be used by the operating system to register additional regions. Linux uses this to <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/arch/powerpc/platforms/powernv/opal.c#L608">register the kernel log buffer</a>. If you're a kernel developer, you could potentially use the OPAL call to register your own interesting bits of memory.</p>
<p>So, the MDST is all set up, we go about doing our business, and suddenly we checkstop. The FSP does its sysdump magic and a few minutes later it reboots the system. What now?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After we come back up, the FSP notifies OPAL that a new dump is available. Linux exposes the dump to userspace under <code>/sys/firmware/opal/dump/</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-diag/files/ppc64-diag/">ppc64-diag</a> is a suite of utilities that assist in manipulating FSP dumps, including the <code>opal_errd</code> daemon. <code>opal_errd</code> monitors new dumps and saves them in <code>/var/log/dump/</code> for later analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>opal-dump-parse</code> (also in the <code>ppc64-diag</code> suite) can be used to extract the sections we care about from the dump:</p>

<p>There's various other types of dumps and logs that I won't get into here. I'm probably obliged to say that if you're having problems out in the wild, you should probably contact your friendly local IBM Service Representative...</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I've only been working on the Linux kernel for a few months.  Before that, I worked with proprietary source control at work and common tools like GitHub at home.  The concept of the mailing list seemed obtuse to me.  If I noticed a problem with some program, I'd be willing to open an issue on GitHub but not to send an email to a mailing list.  Who still uses those, anyway?</p>
<p>Starting out with the kernel meant I had to figure this email thing out.  <code>git format-patch</code> and <code>git send-email</code> take most of the pain out of formatting and submitting a patch, which is nice.  The patch files generated by <code>format-patch</code> open nicely in Emacs by default, showing all whitespace and letting you pick up any irregularities.  <code>send-email</code> means you can send it to yourself or a friend first, finding anything that looks stupid before being exposed to the public.</p>
<p>And then what?  You've sent an email.  It gets sent to hundreds or thousands of people.  Nowhere near that many will read it.  Some might miss it due to their mail server going down, or the list flagging your post as spam, or requiring moderation.  Some recipients will be bots that archive mail on the list, or publish information about the patch.  If you haven't formatted it correctly, someone will let you know quickly.  If your patch is important or controversial, you'll have all sorts of responses.  If your patch is small or niche, you might not ever hear anything back.</p>
<p>I remember when I sent my first patch.  I was talking to a former colleague who didn't understand the patch/mailing list workflow at all.  I sent him a link to my patch on a mail archive.  I explained it like a pull request - here's my code, you can find the responses.  What's missing from a GitHub-esque pull request?  We don't know what tests it passed.  We don't know if it's been merged yet, or if the maintainer has looked at it.  It takes a bit of digging around to find out who's commented on it.  If it's part of a series, that's awkward to find out as well.  What about revisions of a series?  That's another pain point.</p>
<p>Luckily, these problems do have solutions.  <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">Patchwork</a>, written by fellow OzLabs member <a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org">Jeremy Kerr</a>, changes the way we work with patches.  Project maintainers rely on Pathwork instances, such as <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org">https://patchwork.ozlabs.org</a>, for their day-to-day workflow: tagging reviewers, marking the status of patches, keeping track of tests, acks, reviews and comments in one place.  Missing from this picture is support for series and revisions, which is a feature that's being developed by the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop</a> project.  You can check out their changes in action <a href="https://patchwork.freedesktop.org">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, Patchwork helps patches and email catch up to what GitHub has in terms of ease of information.  We're still missing testing and other hooks.  What about review?  What can we do with email, compared to GitHub and the like?</p>
<p>In my opinion, the biggest feature of email is the ease of review.  Just reply inline and you're done.  There's inline commenting on GitHub and GitLab, which works well but is a bit tacky, people commenting on the same thing overlap and conflict, each comment generates a notification (which can be an email until you turn that off).  Plus, since it's email, it's really easy to bring in additional people to the conversation as necessary.  If there's a super lengthy technical discussion in the kernel, it might just take Linus to resolve.</p>
<p>There are alternatives to just replying to email, too, such as <a href="https://www.gerritcodereview.com/">Gerrit</a>.  Gerrit's pretty popular, and has a huge amount of features.  I understand why people use it, though I'm not much of a fan.  Reason being, it doesn't add to the email workflow, it replaces it.  Plaintext email is supported on pretty much any device, with a bunch of different programs.  From the goals of Patchwork: "patchwork should supplement mailing lists, not replace them".</p>
<p>Linus Torvalds famously explained why he prefers email over GitHub pull requests <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17">here</a>, using <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/linux.kernel/w957vpu3PPU">this</a> pull request from Ben Herrenschmidt as an example of why git's own pull request format is superior to that of GitHub.  Damien Lespiau, who is working on the freedesktop Patchwork fork, <a href="http://damien.lespiau.name/2016/02/augmenting-mailing-lists-with-patchwork.html">outlines on his blog</a> all the issues he has with mailing list workflows and why he thinks mailing lists are a relic of the past.  His work on Patchwork has gone a long way to help fix those problems, however I don't think mailing lists are outdated and superceded, I think they are timeless.  They are a technology-agnostic, simple and free system that will still be around if GitHub dies or alienates its community.</p>
<p>That said, there's still the case of the missing features.  What about automated testing?  What about developer feedback?  What about making a maintainer's life easier?  We've been working on improving these issues, and I'll outline how we're approaching them in a future post.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In POWER land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">IPMI</a> is mostly known as the method to access the machine's console and start interacting with Petitboot. However it also has a plethora of other features, handily described in the 600ish page <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/ipmi-second-gen-interface-spec-v2-rev1-1.html">IPMI specification</a> (which you can go read yourself).</p>
<p>One especially relevant feature to Petitboot however is the 'chassis bootdev' command, which you can use to tell Petitboot to ignore any existing boot order, and only consider boot options of the type you specify (eg. 'network', 'disk', or 'setup' to not boot at all). Support for this has been in Petitboot for a while and should work on just about any machine you can get your hands on.</p>
<h2>Network Overrides</h2>
<p>Over in OpenPOWER<sup>1</sup> land however, someone took this idea and pushed it further - why not allow the network configuration to be overwritten too? This isn't in the IPMI spec, but if you cast your gaze down to page 398 where the spec lays out the entire format of the IPMI request, there is a certain field named "OEM Parameters". This is an optional amount of space set aside for whatever you like, which in this case is going to be data describing an override of the network config.</p>
<p>This allows a user to tell Petitboot over IPMI to either;</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the network completely,</li>
<li>Set a particular interface to use DHCP, or</li>
<li>Set a particular interface to use a specific static configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these options will cause any existing network configurations to be ignored.</p>
<h2>Building the Request</h2>
<p>Since this is an OEM-specific command, your average ipmitool package isn't going to have a nice way of making this request, such as 'chassis bootdev network'. Rather you need to do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ipmitool -I lanplus -H $yourbmc -U $user -P $pass raw 0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80 0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21 0x00 0x01 0x06 0x04 0xf4 0x52 0x14 0xf3 0x01 0xdf 0x00 0x01 0x0a 0x3d 0xa1 0x42 0x10 0x0a 0x3d 0x2 0x1
</pre></div>


<p>Horrific right? In the near future the Petitboot tree will include a helper program to format this request for you, but in the meantime (and for future reference), lets lay out how to put this together:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Specify the &quot;chassis bootdev&quot; command, field 96, data field 1:
    0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80

Unique value that Petitboot recognises:
    0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21

Version field (1)
    0x00 0x01 ..   ..

Size of the hardware address (6):
    ..   ..   0x06 ..

Size of the IP address (IPv4/IPv6):
    ..   ..   ..   0x04

Hardware (MAC) address:
    0xf4 0x52 0x14 0xf3
    0x01 0xdf ..   ..

&#39;Ignore flag&#39; and DHCP/Static flag (DHCP is 0)
    ..   ..   0x00 0x01

(Below fields only required if setting a static IP)

IP Address:
    0x0a 0x3d 0xa1 0x42

Subnet Mask (eg, /16):
    0x10 ..   ..   ..
Gateway IP Address:
    ..   0x0a 0x3d 0x02
    0x01
</pre></div>


<p>Clearing a network override is as simple as making a request empty aside from the header:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0x00 0x08 0x61 0x80 0x21 0x70 0x62 0x21 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00
</pre></div>


<p>You can also read back the request over IPMI with this request:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0x00 0x09 0x61 0x00 0x00
</pre></div>


<p>That's it! Ideally this is something you would be scripting rather than bashing out on the keyboard - the main use case at the moment is as a way to force a machine to netboot against a known good source, rather than whatever may be available on its other interfaces.</p>
<p>[1] The reason this is only available on OpenPOWER machines at the moment is that support for the IPMI command itself depends on the BMC firmware, and non-OpenPOWER machines use an FSP which is a different platform.</p></div>
