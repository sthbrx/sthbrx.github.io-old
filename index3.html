  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently most of us attended LCA2016. This is one set of reflections on what we heard and what we've thought since. (Hopefully not the only set of reflections that will be posted on this blog either!)</p>
<p>LCA was 2 days of miniconferences plus 3 days of talks. Here, I've picked some of the more interesting talks I attended, and I've written down some thoughts. If you find the thoughts interesting, you can click through and watch the whole talk video, because LCA is awesome like that.</p>
<h4>Life is better with Rust's community automation</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIageYT0Vgg">This talk</a> is probably the one that's had the biggest impact on our team so far. We were really impressed by the community automation that Rust has: the way they can respond to pull requests from new community members in a way that lets them keep their code quality high and be nice to everyone at the same time.</p>
<p>The system that they've developed is fascinating (and seems fantastic). However, their system uses pull requests, while we use mailing lists. Pull requests are easy, because github has good hook support, but how do we link mailing lists to an automatic test system?</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is something we're working on: we already have <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/">Patchwork</a>, and <a href="https://openpower.xyz/">Jenkins</a>: how do we link them? We have something brewing, which we'll open source real soon now - stay tuned!</p>
<h4>Usable formal methods - are we there yet?</h4>
<p>I liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxHjhBVOCSU">this talk</a>, as I have a soft spot for formal methods (as I have a soft spot for maths). It covers applying a bunch of static analysis and some of the less intrusive formal methods (in particular <a href="http://www.cprover.org/cbmc/">cbmc</a>) to an operating system kernel. They were looking at eChronos rather than Linux, but it's still quite an interesting set of results.</p>
<p>We've also tried to increase our use of static analysis, which has already found a <a href="http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/580629/">real bug</a>. We're hoping to scale this up, especially the use of sparse and cppcheck, but we're a bit short on developer cycles for it at the moment.</p>
<h4>Adventures in OpenPower Firmware</h4>
<p>Stewart Smith - another OzLabber - gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XGvssR-ag">this talk</a> about, well, OpenPOWER firmware. This is a large part of our lives in OzLabs, so it's a great way to get a picture of what we do each day. It's also a really good explanation of the open source stack we have: a POWER8 CPU runs open-source from the first cycle.</p>
<h4>What Happens When 4096 Cores <code>All Do synchronize_rcu_expedited()</code>?</h4>
<p>Paul McKenney is a parallel programming genius - he literally <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html">'wrote the book'</a> (or at least, wrote <em>a</em> book!) on it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nfpjHTWaUc">His talk</a> is - as always - a brain-stretching look at parallel programming within the RCU subsystem of the Linux kernel. In particular, the tree structure for locking that he presents is really interesting and quite a clever way of scaling what at first seems to be a necessarily global lock.</p>
<p>I'd also really recommed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFmajPt0_hI">RCU Mutation Testing</a>, from the kernel miniconf, also by Paul.</p>
<h4>What I've learned as the kernel docs maintainer</h4>
<p>As an extra bonus: I mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsJXf6oSbAE">this talk</a>, just to say "why on earth have we still not fixed the Linux kernel <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/linux/README">README</a>"?!!?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I first started at IBM I knew how to alter Javascript and compile it. This is because of my many years playing Minecraft (yes I am a nerd). Now I have leveled up! I can understand and use Bash, Assembly, Python, Ruby and C! Writing full programs in any of these languages is a very difficult prospect but none the less achievable with what I know now. Whereas two weeks ago it would have been impossible. Working here even for a short time has been an amazing Learning experience for me, plus it looks great on a resume! Learning how to write C has been one of the most useful things I have learnt. I have already written programs for use both in and out of IBM. The first program I wrote was the standard newbie 'hello world' exercise. I have now expanded on that program so that it now says, "Hello world! This is Callum Scarvell". This is done using strings that recognise my name as a set character. Then I used a header file called conio.h or curses.h to recognise 'cal' as the short form of my name. This is so now I can abbreviate my name easier. Heres what the code looks like:</p>

<p>The last two lines have been left out to make it a challenge to recreate. Feel free to test your own knowledge of C to finish the program! My ultimate goal for this program is to make it generate the text 'Hello World! This is Callum Scarvell's computer. Everybody else beware!'(which is easy) then import it into the Linux kernel to the profile login screen. Then I will have my own unique copy of the kernel. And I could call myself an LSD(Linux system developer). That's just a small pet project I have been working on in my time here. Another pet project of mine is my own very altered copy of the open source game NetHack. It's written in C as well and is very easy to tinker with. I have been able to do things like set my characters starting hit points to 40, give my character awesome starting gear and keep save files even after the death of a character. These are just a couple small projects that made learning C so much easier and a lot more fun. And the whole time I was learning C, Ruby, or Python I had some of the best system developers in the world showing me the ropes. This made things even easier, and much more comprehensive. So really its no surprise that in three short weeks I managed to learn almost four different languages and how to run a blog from the raw source code. The knowledge given to me by the OzLabs team is priceless and invaluable. I will forever remember all the new faces and what they taught me. And the <em>Linux Gods</em> will answer your prayers whether e-mail or in person because they walk among us! So if you ever get an opportunity to do work experience, internship or a graduate placement take the chance to do it because you will learn many things that are not taught in school.</p>
<p>If you would like to reveiw the source code for the blog or my work in general you can find me at <a href="https://github.com/CallumScar">CallumScar.github.com</a> or find me on facebook, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/callum.scarvell/about">Callum Scarvell</a>. </p>
<p>And a huge thankyou to the OzLabs team for taking me on for the three weeks and for teaching me so much! I am forever indebted to everyone here.   </p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a recent year twelve graduate my knowledge of computer science was very limited and my ability to write working programs was all but none. So you can imagine my excitement when I heard of an opening for work experience with IBM's internationally renowned Ozlabs team, or as I knew them the <em>Linux Gods</em>. My first day of working at Ozlabs I learnt more about programing then in six years of secondary education. I met most of the Ozlabs team and made connections that will certainly help with my pursuit of a career in IT. Because in business its who you know more than what you know, and now I know the guys at Ozlabs I know how to write code and run it on my own Linux Distro. And on top of all the extremely valuable knowledge I am on a first name basis with the <em>Linux Gods</em> at the LTC.</p>
<p>After my first week at Ozlabs I cloned this blog from Octopress and reformatted it for pelican static site generator.For those who don't know Octopress is a ruby based static site generator so converting the embedded ruby gems to pelicans python code was no easy task for this newbie. Luckily I had a team of some of the best software developers in the world to help and teach me their ways. After we sorted the change from ruby to python and I was able to understand both languages, I presented my work to the team. They then decided to throw me a curve ball as they did not like any of pelicans default themes, instead they wanted the original Octopress theme on the new blog. This is how I learnt GitHub is my bestest friend, because some kind soul had already converted the ruby theme into python and it ran perfectly!</p>
<p>Now it was a simple task of re-formatting the ruby-gem text files into markdown which is pelican compatible(which is why we chose pelican in the first place). So now we had a working pelican blog on the Octopress theme, one issue it was very annoying to navigate. Using my newly learned skills and understanding of python I inserted tags, categories, web-links, navigation bar and I started learning how to code C. And it all worked fine! That was what I a newbie could accomplish in one week. I still have two more weeks left here and I have plenty of really interesting work left to do. This has been one of the greatest learning experiences of my life and I would do it again if I could! So if you are looking for experience in it or software development look no further because you could be learning to code from the people who wrote the language itself.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a tale of a simple problem, with a relatively simple solution, that ended up being pretty complicated.</p>
<p>The BMC of OpenPOWER machines expose a serial console.  It's pretty useful for getting information as the system is booting, or when it's having issues and the network is down.  OpenPOWER machines also have runtime firmware, namely <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot">skiboot</a>, which the Linux kernel calls to make certain things happen.  One of those is writing to the serial console.  There's a function that <a href="https://github.com/open-power/skiboot/blob/master/core/opal.c">skiboot exposes</a>, <code>opal_poll_events()</code> (which then calls <code>opal_run_pollers()</code>), which the kernel calls frequently.  Among other things, it performs a partial flush of the serial console.  And that all works fine...until the kernel panics.</p>
<p>Well, the kernel is in panic.  Who cares if it flushes the console?  It's dead.  It doesn't need to do anything else.</p>
<p>Oh, right.  It prints the reason it panicked.  Turns out that's pretty useful.</p>
<p>There's a pretty simple fix here that we can push into the firmware.  Most kernels are configured to reboot after panic, typically with some delay.  In OpenPOWER, the kernel reboots by calling into skiboot with the <code>opal_cec_reboot()</code> function.  So all we need to do is flush out the console buffer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">int64</span> <span class="nf">opal_cec_reboot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;OPAL: Reboot request...</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s">&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="n">console_complete_flush</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">// &lt;-- what I added</span>

    <span class="c1">// rebooting stuff happens here...</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">OPAL_SUCCESS</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Writing a complete flushing function was pretty easy, then call it from the power down and reboot functions.  Easy, all nicely contained in firmware.</p>
<p>Now, what if the kernel isn't configured to reboot after panic.  Or, what if the reboot timer is really long?  Do you want to wait 3 minutes to see your panic output?  Probably not.  We need to call the pollers after panic.</p>
<p>First, I had to figure out what the kernel actually <em>does</em> when it panics.  Let's have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/kernel/panic.c">panic function itself</a> to figure out where we could work some code in.</p>
<p>In the <code>panic()</code> function, the easiest place I found to put in some code was <code>panic_blink()</code>.  This is supposed to be a function to blink the LEDs on your keyboard when the kernel is panicking, but we could set it to <code>opal_poll_events()</code> and it'd work fine.  There, problem solved!</p>
<p>Oh, wait.  That will never get accepted upstream, ever.  Let's try again.</p>
<p>Well, there are <code>#ifdef</code>s in the code that are architecture specific, for s390 and SPARC.  I could add an <code>#ifdef</code> to check if we're an OpenPOWER machine, and if so, run the pollers a bunch of times.  That would also involve including architecture specific code from <code>arch/powerpc</code>, and that's somewhat gross.  Maybe I could upstream this, but it'd be difficult.  There must be a better way.</p>
<p>As a kernel noob, I found myself digging into what every function called by <code>panic()</code> actually did, to see if there's a way I could use it.  I looked over it at first, but eventually I started looking harder at this line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    <span class="n">kmsg_dump</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">KMSG_DUMP_PANIC</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It turns out <code>kmsg_dump()</code> does what it says: dumps messages from the kernel.  Different parts of the kernel can register their own dumpers, so the kernel can have a variety of dumpers for different purposes.  One existing example in OpenPOWER is a kmsg dumper that stores messages in <code>nvram</code> (non-volatile RAM), so you can find it after you reboot.</p>
<p>Well, we don't really want to dump any output, it's already been sent to the output buffer.  We just need to flush it.  Pretty simple, just call <code>opal_poll_events()</code> a whole bunch of times, right?  That <em>would</em> work, though it'd be nice to have a better way than just calling the pollers.  Instead, we can add a new API call to skiboot specifically for console flushing, and call it from the kmsg dumper.</p>
<p>Initially, I wired up the skiboot complete console flushing function to a new OPAL API call, and called that from the kernel.  After some feedback, this was refactored into a partial, incremental flush so it was more generic.  I also had to consider what happened if the machine was running a newer kernel and an older skiboot, so if the skiboot version didn't have my new flushing call it would fall back to calling the pollers an arbitrary amount of times.</p>
<p>In the end, it looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cm">/*</span>
<span class="cm"> * Console output is controlled by OPAL firmware.  The kernel regularly calls</span>
<span class="cm"> * OPAL_POLL_EVENTS, which flushes some console output.  In a panic state,</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous life I tutored first year computing. The university I
attended had a policy of using C to introduce first years to programming.
One of the most rewarding aspects of teaching is opening doors of
possibility to people by sharing my knowledge.</p>
<p>Over the years I had a mixture of computer science or computer engineering
students as well as other disciplines of engineering who were required to
learn the basics (notably electrical and mechanical). Each class was
different and the initial knowledge always varied greatly. The beauty of
teaching C meant that there was never someone who truly knew it all, heck,
I didn't and still don't. The other advantage of teaching C is that I could
very quickly spot the hackers, the shy person at the back of the room who's
eyes light up when you know you've correctly explained pointers (to them
anyway) or when asked "What happens if you use a negative index into an
array" and the smile they would make upon hearing "What do you think happens".</p>
<p>Right there I would see the makings of a hacker, and this post is dedicated
to you or to anyone who wants to be a hacker. I've been asked "What did you
do to get where you are?", "How do I get into Linux?" (vague much) at
careers fairs. I never quite know what to say, here goes a braindump.</p>
<p>Start with the basics, one of the easiest way we tested the first years was
to tell them they can't use parts of libc. That was a great exam, taking
aside those who didn't read the question and used <code>strlen()</code> when they were
explicitly told they couldn't <code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</code> a true hacker doesn't
need libc, understand it won't always be there. I thought of this example
because only two weeks ago I was writing code in an environment where I
didn't have libc. Ok sure, if you've got it, use it, just don't crumble
when you don't. Oh how I wish I could have told those students who argued
that it was a pointless question that they were objectively wrong.</p>
<p>Be a fan of assembly, don't be afraid of it, it doesn't bite and it can be
a lot of fun. I wouldn't encourage you to dive right into the PowerISA,
it's intense but perhaps understand the beauty of GCC, know what it's doing
for you. There is a variety of little 8 bit processors you can play with
these days.</p>
<p>At all levels of my teaching I saw almost everyone get something which
'worked', and that's fine, it probably does but I'm here to tell you that
it doesn't work until you know why it works. I'm all for the 'try it and
see' approach but once you've tried it you have to explain why the
behaviour changed otherwise you didn't fix it. As an extension to that,
know how your tools work, I don't think anyone would expect you to be able
to write tools to the level of complexity of GCC or GDB or Valgrind but
have a rough idea as to how they achieve their goals.</p>
<p>A hacker is paranoid, yes, <code>malloc()</code> fails. Linux might just decide now
isn't a good time for you to <code>open()</code> and your <code>fopen()</code> calling function had
better be cool with that. A hacker also doesn't rely on the kindness of the
operating system theres an <code>munmap()</code> for a reason. Nor should you even
completely trust it, what are you leaving around in memory?</p>
<p>Above all do a it for the fun of it, so many of my students asked how I
knew everything I knew (I was only a year ahead of them in my first year of
teaching) and put simply, write code on a Saturday night.</p>
<p>None of these things do or don't make you a hacker, being a hacker is a
frame of mind and a way of thinking but all of the above helps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there isn't a single path, I might even say it is a path that
chooses you. Odds are you're here because you approached me at some point
and asked me one of those questions I never quite know how to answer.
Perhaps this is the path, at the very least you're asking questions and
approaching people. I'm hope I did on the day, but once again, all the very
best with your endeavours into the future</p></div>
