  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Userspace</h2>
<p>When writing C programs in userspace there is libc which does so much
of the heavy lifting. One important thing libc provides is portability
in performing syscalls, that is, you don't need to know the
architectural details of performing a syscall on each architecture
your program might be compiled for. Another important feature that
libc provides for the average userspace programmer is highly optimised
routines to do things that are usually performance critical. It would
be extremely inefficient for each userspace programmer if they had to
implement even the naive version of these functions let alone
optimised versions. Let us take <code>memcmp()</code> for example, I could
trivially implement this in C like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">memcmp</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">uint8_t</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">p2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">n</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">p2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">p1</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">p2</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">])</span>
            <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>However, while it is incredibly portable it is simply not going to
perform, which is why the nice people who write libc have highly
optimised ones in assembly for each architecture.</p>
<h2>Kernel</h2>
<p>When writing code for the Linux kernel, there isn't the luxury of a
fully featured libc since it expects (and needs) to be in userspace,
therefore we need to implement the features we need ourselves. Linux
doesn't need all the features but something like <code>memcmp()</code> is
definitely a requirement.</p>
<p>There have been some recent optimisations in <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob_plain;f=sysdeps/powerpc/powerpc64/power8/memcmp.S;h=46b9c0067ad7cd74a36c4800ebfe03eb1be0311e;hb=dec4a7105edcdbabdcac5f358f5bc5dca4f4ed1b" title="power8 optimised memcmp">glibc</a> from which the
kernel could benefit too! The question to be asked is, does the glibc
optimised <code>power8_memcmp()</code> actually go faster or is it all smoke and
mirrors?</p>
<h2>Benchmarking <code>memcmp()</code></h2>
<p>With things like <code>memcmp()</code> it is actually quite easy to choose
datasets which can make any implementation look good. For example; the
new <code>power8_memcmp()</code> makes use of the vector unit of the power8
processor, in order to do so in the kernel there must be a small
amount of setup code so that the rest of the kernel knows that the
vector unit has been used and it correctly saves and restores the
userspace vector registers. This means that <code>power8_memcmp()</code> has a
slightly larger overhead than the current one, so for small compares
or compares which are different early on then the newer 'faster'
<code>power8_memcmp()</code> might actually not perform as well. For any kind of
large compare however, using the vector unit should outperform a CPU
register load and compare loop. It is for this reason that I wanted to
avoid using micro benchmarks and use a 'real world' test as much as
possible.</p>
<p>The biggest user of <code>memcmp()</code> in the kernel, at least on POWER is Kernel
Samepage Merging (KSM). KSM provides code to inspect all the pages of
a running system to determine if they're identical and deduplicate
them if possible. This kind of feature allows for memory overcommit
when used in a KVM host environment as guest kernels are likely to
have a lot of similar, readonly pages which can be merged with no
overhead afterwards. In order to determine if the pages are the same
KSM must do a lot of page sized <code>memcmp()</code>.</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Performing a lot of page sized <code>memcmp()</code> is the one flaw with this
test, the sizes of the <code>memcmp()</code> don't vary, hopefully the data will be
'random' enough that we can still observe differences in the two
approaches.</p>
<p>My approach for testing involved getting the delta of <code>ktime_get()</code>
across calls to <code>memcmp()</code> in <code>memcmp_pages()</code> (mm/ksm.c). This actually
generated massive amounts of data, so, for consistency the following
analysis is performed on the first 400MB of deltas collected.</p>
<p>The host was compiled with <code>powernv_defconfig</code> and run out of a
ramdisk. For consistency the host was rebooted between each run so as
to not have any previous tests affect the next. The host was rebooted
a total of six times, the first three with my 'patched'
<code>power8_memcmp()</code> kernel was booted the second three times with just
my data collection patch applied, the 'vanilla' kernel. Both
kernels are based off <code>4.13-rc3</code>.</p>
<p>Each boot the following script was run and the resulting deltas file
saved somewhere before reboot. The command line argument was always
15.</p>

<p>The guest kernel was a <code>pseries_le_defconfig</code> <code>4.13-rc3</code> with the same
ramdisk the host used. It booted to the login prompt and was left to
idle.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>A variety of histograms were then generated in an attempt to see how
the behaviour of <code>memcmp()</code> changed between the two implementations.
It should be noted here that the y axis in the following graphs is a
log scale as there were a lot of small deltas. The first observation
is that the vanilla kernel had more smaller deltas, this is made
particularly evident by the 'tally' points which are a running total
of all deltas with less than the tally value.</p>
<p><img alt="Sample 1 - Deltas below 200ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-200.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 200ns">
Graph 1 depicting the vanilla kernel having a greater amount of small
(sub 20ns) deltas than the patched kernel. The green points rise
faster (left to right) and higher than the yellow points.</p>
<p>Still looking at the tallies, <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-200.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 200ns">graph 1</a> also shows that the tally
of deltas is very close by the 100ns mark, which means that the
overhead of <code>power8_memcmp()</code> is not too great.</p>
<p>The problem with looking at only deltas under 200ns is that the
performance results we want, that is, the difference between the
algorithms is being masked by things like cache effects. To avoid this
problem is may be wise to look at longer running (larger delta)
<code>memcmp()</code> calls.</p>
<p>The following graph plots all deltas below 5000ns - still relatively
short calls to <code>memcmp()</code> but an interesting trend emerges:
<img alt="Sample 1 - Deltas below 5000ns" src="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-5000.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 5000ns">
Graph 2 shows that above 500ns the blue (patched kernel) points appear
to have all shifted left with respect to the purple (vanilla kernel)
points. This shows that for any <code>memcmp()</code> which will take more than
500ns to get a result it is favourable to use <code>power8_memcmp()</code> and it
is only detrimental to use  <code>power8_memcmp()</code> if the time will be
under 50ns (a conservative estimate).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-200.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 200ns">graph 1</a> and <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/deltas1-5000.png" title="Sample 1: Deltas below 5000ns">graph 2</a> are generated by
combining the first run of data collected from the vanilla and patched
kernels. All the deltas for both runs are can be viewed separately
<a href="/images/power8_memcmp/vanilla_deltas1.png" title="All vanilla deltas">here for vanilla</a> and <a href="/images/power8_memcmp/patched_deltas1.png" title="All patched deltas">here for patched</a>. Finally, the results
from the other four runs look very much identical and provide me with
a fair amount of confidence that these results make sense.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It is important to separate possible KSM optimisations with generic
<code>memcmp()</code> optimisations, for example, perhaps KSM shouldn't be
calling <code>memcmp()</code> if it suspects the first byte will differ. On the
other hand, things that <code>power8_memcmp()</code> could do (which it currently
doesn't) is check the length parameter and perhaps avoid the overhead
of enabling kernel vector if the compare is less than some small
amount of bytes.</p>
<p>It does seem like at least for the 'average case' glibcs
<code>power8_memcmp()</code> is an improvement over what we have now.</p>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>A second round of data collection and plotting of delta vs position of
first byte to differ should confirm these results, this would mean a
more invasive patch to KSM.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post is a bit of a break from the standard IBM fare of this blog,
as I now work for Canonical. But I have a soft spot for Power from my
time at IBM - and Canonical officially supports 64-bit, little-endian
Power - so when I get a spare moment I try to make sure that cool,
officially-supported technologies work on Power <em>before</em> we end up
with a customer emergency! So, without further ado, this is the story
of XDP on Power.</p>
<h2>XDP</h2>
<p>eXpress Data Path (XDP) is a cool Linux technology to allow really
fast processing of network packets.</p>
<p>Normally in Linux, a packet is received by the network card, an SKB
(<a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/skb.html">socket buffer</a>) is
allocated, and the packet is passed up through the networking stack.</p>
<p>This introduces an inescapable latency penalty: we have to allocate
some memory and copy stuff around. XDP allows some network cards and
drivers to process packets early - even before the allocation of the
SKB. This is much faster, and so has applications in DDOS mitigation
and other high-speed networking use-cases. The IOVisor project has
<a href="https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp">much more information</a> if you
want to learn more.</p>
<h2>eBPF</h2>
<p>XDP processing is done by an eBPF program. eBPF - the extended
Berkeley Packet Filter - is an in-kernel virtual machine with a
limited set of instructions. The kernel can statically validate eBPF
programs to ensure that they terminate and are memory safe. From this
it follows that the programs cannot be Turing-complete: they do not
have backward branches, so they cannot do fancy things like
loops. Nonetheless, they're surprisingly powerful for packet
processing and tracing. eBPF programs are translated into efficient
machine code using in-kernel JIT compilers on many platforms, and
interpreted on platforms that do not have a JIT. (Yes, there are
multiple JIT implementations in the kernel. I find this a terrifying
thought.)</p>
<p>Rather than requiring people to write raw eBPF programs, you can write
them in a somewhat-restricted subset of C, and use Clang's eBPF target
to translate them. This is super handy, as it gives you access to the
kernel headers - which define a number of useful data structures like
headers for various network protocols.</p>
<h2>Trying it</h2>
<p>There are a few really interesting project that are already up and
running that allow you to explore XDP without learning the innards of
both eBPF and the kernel networking stack. I explored the samples in
the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">bcc compiler collection</a> and also
the samples from the <a href="https://github.com/netoptimizer/prototype-kernel/">netoptimizer/prototype-kernel repository</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get started with these is with a virtual machine,
as recent virtio network drivers support XDP. If you are using Ubuntu,
you can use the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/cloud-images-and-uvtool.html">uvt-kvm
tooling</a>
to trivially set up a VM running Ubuntu Zesty on your local machine.</p>
<p>Once your VM is installed, you need to shut it down and edit the virsh XML. </p>
<p>You need 2 vCPUs (or more) and a virtio+vhost network card. You also
need to edit the 'interface' section and add the following snippet
(with thanks to the <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/xdp-newbies/msg00029.html">xdp-newbies
list</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;driver</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&#39;vhost&#39;</span> <span class="na">queues=</span><span class="s">&#39;4&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/driver&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(If you have more than 2 vCPUs, set the queues parameter to 2x the
number of vCPUs.)</p>
<p>Then, install a modern clang (we've had issues with 3.8 - I recommend
v4+), and the usual build tools.</p>
<p>I recommend testing with the prototype-kernel tools - the DDOS
prevention tool is a good demo. Then - on x86 - you just follow their
instructions. I'm not going to repeat that here.</p>
<h2>POWERful XDP</h2>
<p>What happens when you try this on Power? Regular readers of my posts
will know to expect some
<a href="https://sthbrx.github.io/blog/2017/02/13/high-power-lustre/">minor</a>
<a href="https://sthbrx.github.io/blog/2017/02/01/namd-on-nvlink/">hitches</a>.</p>
<p>XDP does not disappoint.</p>
<p>Firstly, the prototype-kernel repository <a href="https://github.com/netoptimizer/prototype-kernel/blob/master/kernel/samples/bpf/Makefile#L92">hard codes x86</a>
as the architecture for kernel headers. You need to change it for
powerpc.</p>
<p>Then, once you get the stuff compiled, and try to run it on a
current-at-time-of-writing Zesty kernel, you'll hit a massive debug
splat ending in:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>32: (61) r1 = *(u32 *)(r8 +12)
misaligned packet access off 0+18+12 size 4
load_bpf_file: Permission denied
</pre></div>


<p>It turns out this is because in Ubuntu's Zesty kernel,
CONFIG_HAS_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS is not set on ppc64el. Because
of that, the eBPF verifier will check that all loads are aligned - and
this load (part of checking some packet header) is not, and so the
verifier rejects the program. Unaligned access is not enabled because
the Zesty kernel is being compiled for CPU_POWER7 instead of
CPU_POWER8, and we don't have efficient unaligned access on POWER7.</p>
<p>As it turns out, IBM never released any officially supported Power7 LE
systems - LE was only ever supported on Power8. So, I <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1699627">filed a bug</a> and
<a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2017-June/085074.html">sent a patch</a>
to build Zesty kernels for POWER8 instead, and that has been accepted
and will be part of the next stable update due real soon now.</p>
<p>Sure enough, if you install a kernel with that config change, you can
verify the XDP program and load it into the kernel!</p>
<p>If you have real powerpc hardware, that's enough to use XDP on Power!
Thanks to <a href="http://michael.ellerman.id.au/">Michael Ellerman</a>,
maintainer extraordinaire, for verifying this for me.</p>
<p>If - like me - you don't have ready access to Power hardware, you're
stuffed. You can't use qemu in TCG mode: to use XDP with a VM, you
need multi-queue support, which only exists in the vhost driver, which
is only available for KVM guests. Maybe IBM should release a developer
workstation. (Hint, hint!)</p>
<p>Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy things were for people
with real ppc hardware - it's encouraging to see something not require
kernel changes!</p>
<p>eBPF and XDP are definitely growing technologies - as <a href="https://twitter.com/brendangregg/status/866078955530444800">Brendan Gregg notes</a>,
now is a good time to learn them! (And those on Power have no excuse
either!)</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>To evaluate CephFS, we will create a ppc64le virtual machine, with sufficient
space to compile the software, as well as 3 sparse 1TB disks to create the
object store.</p>
<p>We will then build &amp; install the Ceph packages, after adding the PowerPC
optimisiations to the code. This is done, as ceph-deploy will fetch prebuilt
packages that do not have the performance patches if the packages are not
installed.</p>
<p>Finally, we will use the ceph-deploy to deploy the instance. We will ceph-deploy
via pip, to avoid file conflicts with the packages that we built.</p>
<p>For more information on what each command does, visit the following tutorial,
upon which which this is based:

<h3>Virtual Machine Config</h3>
<p>Create a virtual machine with at least the following:

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We left <a href="/blog/2017/03/20/erasure-coding-for-programmers-part-1/">part 1</a> having explored GF(2^8) and RAID 6, and asking the question "what does all this have to do with Erasure Codes?"</p>
<p>Basically, the thinking goes "RAID 6 is cool, but what if, instead of two parity disks, we had an arbitrary number of parity disks?"</p>
<p>How would we do that? Well, let's introduce our new best friend: Coding Theory!</p>
<p>Say we want to transmit some data across an error-prone medium. We don't know where the errors might occur, so we add some extra information to allow us to detect and possibly correct for errors. This is a code. Codes are a largish field of engineering, but rather than show off my knowledge about systematic linear block codes, let's press on.</p>
<p>Today, our error-prone medium is an array of inexpensive disks. Now we make this really nice assumption about disks, namely that they are either perfectly reliable or completely missing. In other words, we consider that a disk will either be present or 'erased'. We come up with 'erasure codes' that are able to reconstruct data when it is known to be missing. (This is a slightly different problem to being able to verify and correct data that might or might not be subtly corrupted. Disks also have to deal with this problem, but it is <em>not</em> something erasure codes address!)</p>
<p>The particular code we use is a Reed-Solomon code. The specific details are unimportant, but there's a really good graphical outline of the broad concepts in sections 1 and 3 of <a href="http://jerasure.org/jerasure-2.0/">the Jerasure paper/manual</a>. (Don't go on to section 4.)</p>
<p>That should give you some background on how this works at a pretty basic mathematical level. Implementation is a matter of mapping that maths (matrix multiplication) onto hardware primitives, and making it go fast.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>I'm deliberately <em>not</em> covering some pretty vast areas of what would be required to write your own erasure coding library from scratch. I'm not going to talk about how to compose the matricies, how to invert them, or anything like that. I'm not sure how that would be a helpful exercise - ISA-L and jerasure already exist and do that for you.</p>
<p>What I want to cover is an efficient implementation of the some algorithms, once you have the matricies nailed down.</p>
<p>I'm also going to assume your library already provides a generic multiplication function in GF(2^8). That's required to construct the matrices, so it's a pretty safe assumption.</p>
<h2>The beginnings of an API</h2>
<p>Let's make this a bit more concrete.</p>
<p>This will be heavily based on the <a href="https://01.org/intel%C2%AE-storage-acceleration-library-open-source-version/documentation/isa-l-open-source-api">ISA-L API</a> but you probably want to plug into ISA-L anyway, so that shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>What I want to do is build up from very basic algorithmic components into something useful.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to do is to be able to is Galois Field multiplication of an entire region of bytes by an arbitrary constant.</p>
<p>We basically want <code>gf_vect_mul(size_t len, &lt;something representing the constant&gt;, unsigned char * src, unsigned char * dest)</code></p>
<h3>Simple and slow approach</h3>
<p>The simplest way is to do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void gf_vect_mul_simple(size_t len, unsigned char c, unsigned char * src, unsigned char * dest) {

    size_t i;
    for (i=0; i&lt;len; i++) {
        dest[i] = gf_mul(c, src[i]);
    }
}
</pre></div>


<p>That does multiplication element by element using the library's supplied <code>gf_mul</code> function, which - as the name suggests - does GF(2^8) multiplication of a scalar by a scalar.</p>
<p>This works. The problem is that it is very, painfully, slow - in the order of a few hundred megabytes per second.</p>
<h3>Going faster</h3>
<p>How can we make this faster?</p>
<p>There are a few things we can try: if you want to explore a whole range of different ways to do this, check out the <a href="http://jerasure.org/gf-complete-1.02/">gf-complete</a> project. I'm going to assume we want to skip right to the end and know what is the fastest we've found.</p>
<p>Cast your mind back to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf">RAID 6 paper</a> (PDF). I talked about in <a href="/blog/2017/03/20/erasure-coding-for-programmers-part-1/">part 1</a>. That had a way of doing an efficient multiplication in GF(2^8) using vector instructions.</p>
<p>To refresh your memory, we split the multiplication into two parts - low bits and high bits, looked them up separately in a lookup table, and joined them with XOR. We then discovered that on modern Power chips, we could do that in one instruction with <code>vpermxor</code>.</p>
<p>So, a very simple way to do this would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>generate the table for <code>a</code></li>
<li>for each 16-byte chunk of our input:<ul>
<li>load the input</li>
<li>do the <code>vpermxor</code> with the table</li>
<li>save it out</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generating the tables is reasonably straight-forward, in theory. Recall that the tables are <code>a</code> * {{00},{01},...,{0f}} and <code>a</code> * {{00},{10},..,{f0}} - a couple of loops in C will generate them without difficulty. ISA-L has a function to do this, as does gf-complete in split-table mode, so I won't repeat them here.</p>
<p>So, let's recast our function to take the tables as an input rather than the constant <code>a</code>. Assume we're provided the two tables concatenated into one 32-byte chunk. That would give us:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void gf_vect_mul_v2(size_t len, unsigned char * table, unsigned char * src, unsigned char * dest)
</pre></div>


<p>Here's how you would do it in C:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>void gf_vect_mul_v2(size_t len, unsigned char * table, unsigned char * src, unsigned char * dest) {
        vector unsigned char tbl1, tbl2, in, out;
        size_t i;

        /* Assume table, src, dest are aligned and len is a multiple of 16 */

        tbl1 = vec_ld(16, table);
        tbl2 = vec_ld(0, table);
        for (i=0; i&lt;len; i+=16) {
            in = vec_ld(i, (unsigned char *)src);
            __asm__(&quot;vpermxor %0, %1, %2, %3&quot; : &quot;=v&quot;(out) : &quot;v&quot;(tbl1), &quot;v&quot;(tbl2), &quot;v&quot;(in)
            vec_st(out, i, (unsigned char *)dest);
        }
}
</pre></div>


<p>There's a few quirks to iron out - making sure the table is laid out in the vector register in the way you expect, etc, but that generally works and is quite fast - my Power 8 VM does about 17-18 GB/s with non-cache-contained data with this implementation.</p>
<p>We can go a bit faster by doing larger chunks at a time:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    for (i=0; i&lt;vlen; i+=64) {
            in1 = vec_ld(i, (unsigned char *)src);
            in2 = vec_ld(i+16, (unsigned char *)src);
            in3 = vec_ld(i+32, (unsigned char *)src);
            in4 = vec_ld(i+48, (unsigned char *)src);
            __asm__(&quot;vpermxor %0, %1, %2, %3&quot; : &quot;=v&quot;(out1) : &quot;v&quot;(tbl1), &quot;v&quot;(tbl2), &quot;v&quot;(in1));
            __asm__(&quot;vpermxor %0, %1, %2, %3&quot; : &quot;=v&quot;(out2) : &quot;v&quot;(tbl1), &quot;v&quot;(tbl2), &quot;v&quot;(in2));
            __asm__(&quot;vpermxor %0, %1, %2, %3&quot; : &quot;=v&quot;(out3) : &quot;v&quot;(tbl1), &quot;v&quot;(tbl2), &quot;v&quot;(in3));
            __asm__(&quot;vpermxor %0, %1, %2, %3&quot; : &quot;=v&quot;(out4) : &quot;v&quot;(tbl1), &quot;v&quot;(tbl2), &quot;v&quot;(in4));
            vec_st(out1, i, (unsigned char *)dest);
            vec_st(out2, i+16, (unsigned char *)dest);
            vec_st(out3, i+32, (unsigned char *)dest);
            vec_st(out4, i+48, (unsigned char *)dest);
    }
</pre></div>


<p>This goes at about 23.5 GB/s.</p>
<p>We can go one step further and do the core loop in assembler - that means we control the instruction layout and so on. I tried this: it turns out that for the basic vector multiply loop, if we turn off ASLR and pin to a particular CPU, we can see a improvement of a few percent (and a decrease in variability) over C code.</p>
<h2>Building from vector multiplication</h2>
<p>Once you're comfortable with the core vector multiplication, you can start to build more interesting routines.</p>
<p>A particularly useful one on Power turned out to be the multiply and add routine: like gf_vect_mul, except that rather than overwriting the output, it loads the output and xors the product in. This is a simple extension of the gf_vect_mul function so is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>The next step would be to start building erasure coding proper. Recall that to get an element of our output, we take a dot product: we take the corresponding input element of each disk, multiply it with the corresponding GF(2^8) coding matrix element and sum all those products. So all we need now is a dot product algorithm.</p>
<p>One approach is the conventional dot product:</p>
<ul>
<li>for each element<ul>
<li>zero accumulator</li>
<li>for each source<ul>
<li>load <code>input[source][element]</code></li>
<li>do GF(2^8) multiplication</li>
<li>xor into accumulator</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>save accumulator to <code>output[element]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The other approach is multiply and add:</p>
<ul>
<li>for each source<ul>
<li>for each element<ul>
<li>load <code>input[source][element]</code></li>
<li>do GF(2^8) multiplication</li>
<li>load <code>output[element]</code></li>
<li>xor in product</li>
<li>save <code>output[element]</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The dot product approach has the advantage of fewer writes. The multiply and add approach has the advantage of better cache/prefetch performance. The approach you ultimately go with will probably depend on the characteristics of your machine and the length of data you are dealing with.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, ISA-L ships with only the first approach in x86 assembler, and Jerasure leans heavily towards the second approach.</p>
<p>Once you have a vector dot product sorted, you can build a full erasure coding setup: build your tables with your library, then do a dot product to generate each of your outputs!</p>
<p>In ISA-L, this is implemented something like this:</p>

</pre></div>


<h2>Going faster still</h2>
<p>Eagle eyed readers will notice that however we generate an output, we have to read all the input elements. This means that if we're doing a code with 10 data disks and 4 coding disks, we have to read each of the 10 inputs 4 times.</p>
<p>We could do better if we could calculate multiple outputs for each pass through the inputs. This is a little fiddly to implement, but does lead to a speed improvement.</p>
<p>ISA-L is an excellent example here. Intel goes up to 6 outputs at once: the number of outputs you can do is only limited by how many vector registers you have to put the various operands and results in.</p>
<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Benchmarking is tricky. I do the following on a bare-metal, idle machine, with ASLR off and pinned to an arbitrary hardware thread. (Code is for the <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>for x in (seq 1 50)
    setarch ppc64le -R taskset -c 24 erasure_code/gf_vect_mul_perf
end | awk &#39;/MB/ {sum+=$13} END {print sum/50, &quot;MB/s&quot;}&#39;
</pre></div>


</li>
<li>
<p>Debugging is tricky; the more you can do in C and the less you do in assembly, the easier your life will be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vector code is notoriously alignment-sensitive - if you can't figure out why something is wrong, check alignment. (Pro-tip: ISA-L does <em>not</em> guarantee the alignment of the <code>gftbls</code> parameter, and many of the tests supply an unaligned table from the stack. For testing <code>__attribute__((aligned(16)))</code> is your friend!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related: GCC is moving towards assignment over vector intrinsics, at least on Power:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vector unsigned char a;
unsigned char * data;
// good, also handles word-aligned data with VSX
a = *(vector unsigned char *)data;
// bad, requires special handling of non-16-byte aligned data
a = vec_ld(0, (unsigned char *) data);
</pre></div>


</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully by this point you're equipped to figure out how your erasure coding library of choice works, and write your own optimised implementation (or maintain an implementation written by someone else).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Erasure coding is an increasingly popular storage technology - allowing the same level of fault tolerance as replication with a significantly reduced storage footprint.</p>
<p>Increasingly, erasure coding is available 'out of the box' on storage solutions such as Ceph and OpenStack Swift. Normally, you'd just pull in a library like <a href="https://github.com/01org/isa-l">ISA-L</a> or <a href="http://jerasure.org">jerasure</a>, and set some config options, and you'd be done.</p>
<p>This post is not about that. This post is about how I went from knowing nothing about erasure coding to writing POWER optimised routines to make it go fast. (These are in the process of being polished for upstream at the moment.) If you want to understand how erasure coding works under the hood - and in particular if you're interested in writing optimised routines to make it run quickly in your platform - this is for you.</p>
<h2>What are erasure codes anyway?</h2>
<p>I think the easiest way to begin thinking about erasure codes is "RAID 6 on steroids". RAID 6 allows you to have up to 255 data disks and 2 parity disks (called P and Q), thus allowing you to tolerate the failure of up to 2 arbitrary disks without data loss.</p>
<p>Erasure codes allow you to have k data disks and m 'parity' or coding disks. You then have a total of m + k disks, and you can tolerate the failure of up to m without losing data.</p>
<p>The downside of erasure coding is that computing what to put on those parity disks is CPU intensive. Lets look at what we put on them.</p>
<h2>RAID 6</h2>
<p>RAID 6 is the easiest way to get started on understanding erasure codes for a number of reasons. H Peter Anvin's paper on RAID 6 in the Linux kernel is an excellent start, but does dive in a bit quickly to the underlying mathematics. So before reading that, read on!</p>
<h2>Rings and Fields</h2>
<p>As programmers we're pretty comfortable with modular arithmetic - the idea that if you have:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>unsigned char a = 255;
a++;
</pre></div>


<p>the new value of <code>a</code> will be 0, not 256.</p>
<p>This is an example of an algebraic structure called a <em>ring</em>.</p>
<p>Rings obey certain laws. For our purposes, we'll consider the following incomplete and somewhat simplified list:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an addition operation.</li>
<li>There is an additive identity (normally called 0), such that 'a + 0 = a'.</li>
<li>Every element has an additive inverse, that is, for every element 'a', there is an element -a such that 'a + (-a) = 0'</li>
<li>There is a multiplication operation.</li>
<li>There is a multiplicative identity (normally called 1), such that 'a * 1 = a'.</li>
</ul>
<p>These operations aren't necessarily addition or multiplication as we might expect from the integers or real numbers. For example, in our modular arithmetic example, we have 'wrap around'. (There are also certain rules the addition and multiplication rules must satisfy - we are glossing over them here.)</p>
<p>One thing a ring doesn't have a 'multiplicative inverse'. The multiplicative inverse of some non-zero element of the ring (call it a), is the value b such that a * b = 1. (Often instead of b we write 'a^-1', but that looks bad in plain text, so we shall stick to b for now.)</p>
<p>We do have some inverses in 'mod 256': the inverse of 3 is 171 as 3 * 171 = 513, and 513 = 1 mod 256, but there is no b such that 2 * b = 1 mod 256.</p>
<p>If every non-zero element of our ring had a multiplicative inverse, we would have what is called a <em>field</em>.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at a the integers modulo 2, that is, 0 and 1.</p>
<p>We have this for addition:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>+</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>1</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1</strong></td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Eagle-eyed readers will notice that this is the same as XOR.</p>
<p>For multiplication: </p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>*</th>
<th>0</th>
<th>1</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>0</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>1</strong></td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As we said, a field is a ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. As we can see, the integers modulo 2 shown above is a field: it's a ring, and 1 is its own multiplicative inverse.</p>
<p>So this is all well and good, but you can't really do very much in a field with 2 elements. This is sad, so we make bigger fields. For this application, we consider the Galois Field with 256 elements - GF(2^8). This field has some surprising and useful properties.</p>
<p>Remember how we said that integers modulo 256 weren't a field because they didn't have multiplicative inverses? I also just said that GF(2^8) also has 256 elements, but is a field - i.e., it does have inverses! How does that work?</p>
<p>Consider an element in GF(2^8). There are 2 ways to look at an element in GF(2^8). The first is to consider it as an 8-bit number. So, for example, let's take 100. We can express that as as an 8 bit binary number: 0b01100100.</p>
<p>We can write that more explicitly as a sum of powers of 2:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0 * 2^7 + 1 * 2^6 + 1 * 2^5 + 0 * 2^4 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2 + 0 * 1
= 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^2
</pre></div>


<p>Now the other way we can look at elements in GF(2^8) is to replace the '2's with 'x's, and consider them as polynomials. Each of our bits then represents the coefficient of a term of a polynomial, that is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0 x^7 + 1 x^6 + 1 x^5 + 0 x^4 + 0 x^3 + 1 x^2 + 0 x + 0 * 1
</pre></div>


<p>or more simply</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>x^6 + x^5 + x^2
</pre></div>


<p>Now, and this is <strong>important</strong>: each of the coefficients are elements of the integers modulo 2: x + x = 2x = 0 as 2 mod 2 = 0. There is no concept of 'carrying' in this addition.</p>
<p>Let's try: what's 100 + 79 in GF(2^8)?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>100 = 0b01100100 =&gt; x^6 + x^5 +       x^2
 79 = 0b01001111 =&gt; x^6 +       x^3 + x^2 + x + 1

100 + 79         =&gt;   0 + x^5 + x^3 +   0 + x + 1
                 =    0b00101011 = 43
</pre></div>


<p>So, 100 + 79 = 43 in GF(2^8)</p>
<p>You may notice we could have done that much more efficiently: we can add numbers in GF(2^8) by just XORing their binary representations together. Subtraction, amusingly, is the same as addition: 0 + x = x =  0 - x, as -1 is congruent to 1 modulo 2.</p>
<p>So at this point you might be wanting to explore a few additions yourself. Fortuantely there's a lovely tool that will allow you to do that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo apt install gf-complete-tools
gf_add $A $B 8
</pre></div>


<p>This will give you A + B in GF(2^8).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; gf_add 100 79 8
43
</pre></div>


<p>Excellent!</p>
<p>So, hold on to your hats, as this is where things get really weird. In modular arithmetic example, we considered the elements of our ring to be numbers, and we performed our addition and multiplication modulo 256. In GF(2^8), we consider our elements as polynomials and we perform our addition and multiplication modulo a polynomial. There is one conventional polynomial used in applications:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0x11d =&gt; 0b1 0001 1101 =&gt; x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1
</pre></div>


<p>It is possible to use other polynomials if they satisfy particular requirements, but for our applications we don't need to worry as we will always use 0x11d. I am not going to attempt to explain anything about this polynomial - take it as an article of faith.</p>
<p>So when we multiply two numbers, we multiply their polynomial representations. Then, to find out what that is modulo 0x11d, we do polynomial long division by 0x11d, and take the remainder.</p>
<p>Some examples will help.</p>
<p>Let's multiply 100 by 3.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>100 = 0b01100100 =&gt; x^6 + x^5 + x^2
  3 = 0b00000011 =&gt; x + 1

(x^6 + x^5 + x^2)(x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^3 + x^6 + x^5 + x^2
                         = x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that some of the terms have disappeared: x^6 + x^6 = 0.</p>
<p>The degree (the largest power of a term) is 7. 7 is less than the degree of 0x11d, which is 8, so we don't need to do anything: the remainder modulo 0x11d is simply x^7 + x^5 + x^3 + x^2.</p>
<p>In binary form, that is 0b10101100 = 172, so 100 * 3 = 172 in GF(2^8).</p>
<p>Fortunately <code>gf-complete-tools</code> also allows us to check multiplications:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; gf_mult 100 3 8
172
</pre></div>


<p>Excellent!</p>
<p>Now let's see what happens if we multiply by a larger number. Let's multiply 100 by 5.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>100 = 0b01100100 =&gt; x^6 + x^5 + x^2
  5 = 0b00000101 =&gt; x^2 + 1

(x^6 + x^5 + x^2)(x^2 + 1) = x^8 + x^7 + x^4 + x^6 + x^5 + x^2
                           = x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2
</pre></div>


<p>Here we have an x^8 term, so we have a degree of 8. This means will get a different remainder when we divide by our polynomial. We do this with polynomial long division, which you will hopefully remember if you did some solid algebra in high school.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                              1
                           ---------------------------------------------
x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 | x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4       + x^2
                          - x^8                   + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1
                            -------------------------------------------
                          =       x^7 + x^6 + x^5       + x^3       + 1
</pre></div>


<p>So we have that our original polynomial (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1) is congruent to (x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + x^3 + 1) modulo the polynomial 0x11d.
Looking at the binary representation of that new polynomial, we have 0b11101001 = 233.</p>
<p>Sure enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; gf_mult 100 5 8
233
</pre></div>


<p>Just to solidify the polynomial long division a bit, let's try a slightly larger example, 100 * 9:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>100 = 0b01100100 =&gt; x^6 + x^5 + x^2
  9 = 0b00001001 =&gt; x^3 + 1

(x^6 + x^5 + x^2)(x^3 + 1) = x^9 + x^8 + x^5 + x^6 + x^5 + x^2
                           = x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^2
</pre></div>


<p>Doing long division to reduce our result:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                              x
                           -----------------------------------
x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 | x^9 + x^8       + x^6                   + x^2
                          - x^9                   + x^5 + x^4 + x^3       + x
                            -------------------------------------------------
                          =       x^8       + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x
</pre></div>


<p>We still have a polynomial of degree 8, so we can do another step:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>                              x +   1
                           -----------------------------------
x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1 | x^9 + x^8       + x^6                   + x^2
                          - x^9                   + x^5 + x^4 + x^3       + x
                            -------------------------------------------------
                          =       x^8       + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x
                          -       x^8                   + x^4 + x^3 + x^2     + 1
                                  -----------------------------------------------
                          =                   x^6 + x^5                   + x + 1
</pre></div>


<p>We now have a polynomial of degree less than 8 that is congruent to our original polynomial modulo 0x11d, and the binary form is 0x01100011 = 99.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt; gf_mult 100 9 8
99
</pre></div>


<p>This process can be done more efficiently, of course - but understanding what is going on will make you <em>much</em> more comfortable with what is going on!</p>
<p>I will not try to convince you that all multiplicative inverses exist in this magic shadow land of GF(2^8), but it's important for the rest of the algorithms to work that they do exist. Trust me on this.</p>
<h2>Back to RAID 6</h2>
<p>Equipped with this knowledge, you are ready to take on <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/hpa/raid6.pdf">RAID6 in the kernel</a> (PDF) sections 1 - 2.</p>
<p>Pause when you get to section 3 - this snippet is a bit magic and benefits from some explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multiplication by {02} for a single byte can be implemeted using the C code:</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>uint8_t c, cc;
cc = (c &lt;&lt; 1) ^ ((c &amp; 0x80) ? 0x1d : 0);
</pre></div>


<p>How does this work? Well:</p>
<p>Say you have a binary number 0bNMMM MMMM. Mutiplication by 2 gives you 0bNMMMMMMM0, which is 9 bits. Now, there are two cases to consider.</p>
<p>If your leading bit (N) is 0, your product doesn't have an x^8 term, so we don't need to reduce it modulo the irreducible polynomial.</p>
<p>If your leading bit is 1 however, your product is x^8 + something, which does need to be reduced. Fortunately, because we took an 8 bit number and multiplied it by 2, the largest term is x^8, so we only need to reduce it once. So we xor our number with our polynomial to subtract it.</p>
<p>We implement this by letting the top bit overflow out and then xoring the lower 8 bits with the low 8 bits of the polynomial (0x1d)</p>
<p>So, back to the original statement:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(c &lt;&lt; 1) ^ ((c &amp; 0x80) ? 0x1d : 0)
    |          |          |     |
    &gt; multiply by 2       |     |
               |          |     |
               &gt; is the high bit set - will the product have an x^8 term?
                          |     |
                          &gt; if so, reduce by the polynomial
                                |
                                &gt; otherwise, leave alone
</pre></div>


<p>Hopefully that makes sense.</p>
<h3>Key points</h3>
<p>It's critical you understand the section on Altivec (the vperm stuff), so let's cover it in a bit more detail.</p>
<p>Say you want to do A * V, where A is a constant and V is an 8-bit variable. We can express V as V_a + V_b, where V_a is the top 4 bits of V, and V_b is the bottom 4 bits. A * V = A * V_a + A * V_b</p>
<p>We can then make lookup tables for multiplication by A.</p>
<p>If we did this in the most obvious way, we would need a 256 entry lookup table. But by splitting things into the top and bottom halves, we can reduce that to two 16 entry tables. For example, say A = 02.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>V_a</th>
<th>A * V_a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>00</td>
<td>00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01</td>
<td>02</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>02</td>
<td>04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0f</td>
<td>1e</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>V_b</th>
<th>A * V_b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>00</td>
<td>00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>f0</td>
<td>fd</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We then use vperm to look up entries in these tables and vxor to combine our results.</p>
<p>So - and this is a key point - for each A value we wish to multiply by, we need to generate a new lookup table.</p>
<p>So if we wanted A = 03:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>V_a</th>
<th>A * V_a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>00</td>
<td>00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>01</td>
<td>03</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>02</td>
<td>06</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0f</td>
<td>11</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>V_b</th>
<th>A * V_b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>00</td>
<td>00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>30</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>60</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>f0</td>
<td>0d</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One final thing is that Power8 adds a vpermxor instruction, so we can reduce the entire 4 instruction sequence in the paper:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vsrb v1, v0, v14
vperm v2, v12, v12, v0
vperm v1, v13, v13, v1
vxor v1, v2, v1
</pre></div>


<p>to 1 vpermxor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>vpermxor v1, v12, v13, v0
</pre></div>


<p>Isn't POWER grand?</p>
<h2>OK, but how does this relate to erasure codes?</h2>
<p>I'm glad you asked.</p>
<p>Galois Field arithmetic, and its application in RAID 6 is the basis for erasure coding. (It's also the basis for CRCs - two for the price of one!)</p>
<p>But, that's all to come in part 2, which will definitely be published before 7 April!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Sarah Axtens who reviewed the mathematical content of this post and suggested significant improvements. All errors and gross oversimplifications remain my own. Thanks also to the OzLabs crew for their feedback and comments.</p></div>
